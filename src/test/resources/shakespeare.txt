ACT I
SCENE I. London. The palace.
Enter KING HENRY
So shaken as we are
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes
And furious close of civil butchery
Shall now
Against acquaintance
The edge of war
We are impressed and engaged to fight
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
But this our purpose now is twelve month old
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
Of you
In forwarding this dear expedience.
My liege
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
Whose worst was
Against the irregular and wild Glendower
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
Without much shame retold or spoken of.
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
This match'd with other did
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the north and thus it did import:
On Holy-rood day
For he that brought them
And pride of their contention did take horse
Here is a dear
Stain'd with the variation of each soil
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
Ten thousand bold Scots
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners
Mordake the Earl of Fife
To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol
And is not this an honourable spoil?
A gallant prize? ha
In faith
Yea
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Should be the father to so blest a son
Amongst a grove
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
Whilst I
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay
Then would I have his Harry
But let him from my thoughts. What think you
This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester
Which makes him prune himself
The crest of youth against your dignity.
But I have sent for him to answer this;
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Cousin
Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
But come yourself with speed to us again;
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be uttered.
I will
Exeunt
SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.
Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
Now
Thou art so fat-witted
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
benches after noon
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
the time of the day.
Indeed
purses go by the moon and the seven stars
by Phoebus
save thy grace
thou wilt have none
What
No
prologue to an egg and butter.
Well
Marry
us that are squires of the night's body be called
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
foresters
moon; and let men say we be men of good government
chaste mistress the moon
Thou sayest well
fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
flow like the sea
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
By the Lord
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
As the honey of Hybla
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
How now
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
buff jerkin?
Why
Well
time and oft.
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
No; I'll give thee thy due
Yea
and where it would not
Yea
that thou art heir apparent--But
wag
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
not thou
No; thou shalt.
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord
Thou judgest false already: I mean
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
Well
humour as well as waiting in the court
you.
For obtaining of suits?
Yea
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
Or an old lion
Yea
What sayest thou to a hare
Moor-ditch?
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
the most comparative
prince. But
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
street about you
he talked very wisely
yet he talked wisely
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
streets
O
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
me
thee
should speak truly
wicked. I must give over this life
it over: by the Lord
I'll be damned for never a king's son in
Christendom.
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow
'Zounds
do not
I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
to purse-taking.
Why
man to labour in his vocation.
Enter POINS
Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
match. O
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
a true man.
Good morrow
Good morrow
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
and a cold capon's leg?
Sir John stands to his word
his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
But
o'clock
to Canterbury with rich offerings
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
as secure as sleep. If you will go
your purses full of crowns; if you will not
at home and be hanged.
Hear ye
You will
Hal
Who
There's neither honesty
fellowship in thee
royal
Well then
Why
Well
By the Lord
I care not.
Sir John
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
that he shall go.
Well
the ears of profiting
move and what he hears may be believed
true prince may
thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
Farewell
Exit Falstaff
Now
to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
manage alone. Falstaff
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
yourself and I will not be there; and when they
have the booty
this head off from my shoulders.
How shall we part with them in setting forth?
Why
appoint them a place of meeting
our pleasure to fail
upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
no sooner achieved
Yea
horses
appointment
Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
leave them: and
for the nonce
Yea
Well
true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
third
forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty
least
extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
lies the jest.
Well
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
there I'll sup. Farewell.
Farewell
Exit Poins
I know you all
The unyoked humour of your idleness:
Yet herein will I imitate the sun
To smother up his beauty from the world
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
If all the year were playing holidays
But when they seldom come
So
And pay the debt I never promised
And like bright metal on a sullen ground
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
I'll so offend
Redeeming time when men think least I will.
Exit
SCENE III. London. The palace.
Enter the KING
My blood hath been too cold and temperate
You tread upon my patience: but be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself
Which hath been smooth as oil
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
Our house
The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly.
My lord.--
Worcester
Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
O
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
You have good leave to leave us: when we need
Your use and counsel
Exit Worcester
You were about to speak.
To North
Yea
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded
As is deliver'd to your majesty:
Either envy
Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
My liege
But I remember
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
He was perfumed like a milliner;
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet-box
He gave his nose and took't away again;
Who therewith angry
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
With many holiday and lady terms
He question'd me; amongst the rest
My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
I then
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
Of guns and drums and wounds
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
And that it was great pity
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns
This bald unjointed chat of his
And I beseech you
Come current for an accusation
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
The circumstance consider'd
To such a person and in such a place
To do him wrong or any way impeach
What then he said
Why
His brother-in-law
Who
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Against that great magician
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers
Shall we but treason? and indent with fears
No
For I shall never hold that man my friend
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
Revolted Mortimer!
He never did fall off
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
Three times they breathed and three times did
they drink
Who then
Never did base and rotten policy
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
Nor could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
Thou dost belie him
He never did encounter with Glendower:
I tell thee
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
Art thou not ashamed? But
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland
Send us your prisoners
Exeunt King Henry
An if the devil come and roar for them
And tell him so; for I will ease my heart
What
Here comes your uncle.
Re-enter WORCESTER
Speak of Mortimer!
'Zounds
Want mercy
Yea
As high in the air as this unthankful king
Brother
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
He will
And when I urged the ransom once again
Of my wife's brother
I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
He was; I heard the proclamation:
And then it was when the unhappy king
Upon his Irish expedition;
From whence he intercepted did return
To be deposed and shortly murdered.
And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
But soft
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Heir to the crown?
He did; myself did hear it.
Nay
But shall it be that you
Upon the head of this forgetful man
And for his sake wear the detested blot
Of murderous subornation
O
Wherein you range under this subtle king;
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
And shall it in more shame be further spoken
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
Into the good thoughts of the world again
Of this proud king
To answer all the debt he owes to you
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
Therefore
Peace
And now I will unclasp a secret book
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous
As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
If he fall in
Send danger from the east unto the west
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
Imagination of some great exploit
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
By heaven
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
He apprehends a world of figures here
Good cousin
I cry you mercy.
Those same noble Scots
That are your prisoners
I'll keep them all;
By God
No
I'll keep them
You start away
And lend no ear unto my purposes.
Those prisoners you shall keep.
Nay
He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
But I will find him when he lies asleep
Nay
Nothing but 'Mortimer
To keep his anger still in motion.
Hear you
All studies here I solemnly defy
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales
And would be glad he met with some mischance
Farewell
When you are better temper'd to attend.
Why
Art thou to break into this woman's mood
Why
Of this vile politician
In Richard's time
A plague upon it
'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept
Unto this king of smiles
'Sblood!--
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
At Berkley castle.
You say true:
Why
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
Look
And 'gentle Harry Percy
O
Good uncle
Nay
We will stay your leisure.
I have done
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
Deliver them up without their ransom straight
For powers in Scotland; which
Which I shall send you written
Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd
Of that same noble prelate
Of York
True; who bears hard
His brother's death at Bristol
I speak not this in estimation
Is ruminated
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
I smell it: upon my life
Before the game is afoot
Why
And then the power of Scotland and of York
And so they shall.
In faith
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed
For
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love.
He does
Cousin
Than I by letters shall direct your course.
When time is ripe
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once
Farewell
Uncle
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!

Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day

Enter another Carrier
Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog
is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
Poor fellow
rose; it was the death of him.
I think this be the most villanous house in all
London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
Like a tench! by the mass
christen could be better bit than I have been since
the first cock.
Why

fleas like a loach.
What

thou layest the plot how.
Enter Chamberlain
Good morrow
I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
that hath abundance of charge too
They are up already
they will away presently.

No

as truly as a man of falsehood may.
What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang
Sir John hangs with me

Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
Come

Stand close.
Enter FALSTAFF
Poins! Poins
Peace

Where's Poins
He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
rascal hath removed my horse
not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
further afoot
not but to die a fair death for all this
'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
twenty years
rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
medicines to make me love him
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
not as good a deed as drink
leave these rogues
ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
They whistle
Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse
rogues; give me my horse
Peace
to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
of travellers.
Have you any levers to lift me up again

ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.
O
Hang ye
fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On
You are Grand-jurors
Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt
Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London
would be argument for a week
and a good jest for ever.
Stand close; I hear them coming.
Enter the Thieves again
Come
before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
arrant cowards
no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.
Your money!
Villains!
As they are sharing
Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
So strongly that they dare not meet each other;
Each takes his fellow for an officer.

How the rogue roar'd!

purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why
certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold
drink; but I tell you
nettle
purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and
your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
great an opposition.' Say you so

infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
of fear and cold heart

let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
forward to-night.
Enter LADY PERCY
How now
O
For what offence have I this fortnight been
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
Tell me
Thy stomach
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
Of sallies and retires
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd
On some great sudden hest. O
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand
What
Enter Servant
Is Gilliams with the packet gone?

But hear you
What say'st thou
What is it carries you away?
Why
Out
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
As you are toss'd with. In faith
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
About his title
To line his enterprise: but if you go
So far afoot
Come
Directly unto this question that I ask:
In faith
Away
To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns
What say'st thou
have with me?
Do you not love me? do you not
Well
Nay
Come
And when I am on horseback
I love thee infinitely. But hark you
I must not have you henceforth question me
Whither I go
Whither I must
I know you wise
Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
And so far will I trust thee
How! so far?
Not an inch further. But hark you
Whither I go
To-day will I set forth
Will this content you
It must of force.

I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all

We four set upon some dozen--
Sixteen at least
And bound them.
No
You rogue
am a Jew else
As we were sharing
And unbound the rest
What
All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
not with fifty of them
there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
Jack
Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
Nay
of them; two I am sure I have paid
in buckram suits. I tell thee what
thee a lie
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
What
Four
Ay
These four came all a-front
me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
points in my target
Seven? why
In buckram?
Ay
Seven
Prithee
Dost thou hear me
Ay
Do so
in buckram that I told thee of--
So
Their points being broken
Down fell their hose.
Began to give me ground: but I followed me close
the eleven I paid.
O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
But
knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark
not see thy hand.
These lies are like their father that begets them;

My own knee! when I was about thy years
not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the

Lord Mortimer
And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
I have forgot the map.
No
Sit
Doth speak of you
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
And you in hell
I cannot blame him: at my nativity
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Shaked like a coward.
Why
your mother's cat had but kittened
had never been born.
I say the earth did shake when I was born.
And I say the earth was not of my mind
The heavens were all on fire
O
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
By the imprisoning of unruly wind
Within her womb; which
Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
Our grandam earth
Cousin
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
To tell you once again that at my birth
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
And all the courses of my life do show
I am not in the roll of common men.
Where is he living
That chides the banks of England
And bring him out that is but woman's son
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
And hold me pace in deep experiments.
I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
I'll to dinner.
Peace
I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
Why
But will they come when you do call for them?
Why
The devil.
And I can teach thee
By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
If thou have power to raise him
O
Come
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
Home without boots
How 'scapes he agues
Come
According to our threefold order ta'en?
The archdeacon hath divided it
Into three limits very equally:
England
All westward
The remnant northward
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
Which being sealed interchangeably
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
To meet your father and the Scottish power
My father Glendower is not ready yet
Within that space you may have drawn together
Your tenants
A shorter time shall send me to you
And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
From whom you now must steal and take no leave
Upon the parting of your wives and you.
Methinks my moiety
See how this river comes me cranking in
A huge half-moon
I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
In a new channel
It shall not wind with such a deep indent
Not wind? it shall
Yea
Mark how he bears his course
With like advantage on the other side;
Gelding the opposed continent as much
As on the other side it takes from you.
Yea
And on this north side win this cape of land;
And then he runs straight and even.
I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
I'll not have it alter'd.
Will not you?
No
Who shall say me nay?
Why
Let me not understand you
I can speak English
For I was train'd up in the English court;
Where
Many an English ditty lovely well
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament
Marry
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge
'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
Come
I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
To any well-deserving friend;
But in the way of bargain
Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
I'll haste the writer and withal
Break with your wives of your departure hence:
I am afraid my daughter will run mad
Exit GLENDOWER
Fie
I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant
As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
He held me last night at least nine hours
In reckoning up the several devils' names
That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum
But mark'd him not a word. O
As a tired horse
Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
With cheese and garlic in a windmill
In any summer-house in Christendom.
In faith
In strange concealments
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
As mines of India. Shall I tell you
He holds your temper in a high respect
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
When you come 'cross his humour; faith
I warrant you
Might so have tempted him as you have done
But do not use it oft
In faith
And since your coming hither have done enough
To put him quite beside his patience.
You must needs learn
Though sometimes it show greatness
And that's the dearest grace it renders you
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
The least of which haunting a nobleman
Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
Upon the beauty of all parts besides
Well
Here come our wives
Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
This is the deadly spite that angers me;
My wife can speak no English
My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;
She'll be a soldier too
Good father
Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
Glendower speaks to her in Welsh
She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry
The lady speaks in Welsh
I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
I am too perfect in; and
The lady speaks again in Welsh
I understand thy kisses and thou mine
But I will never be a truant
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd
Nay
The lady speaks again in Welsh
O
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
And rest your gentle head upon her lap
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
As is the difference betwixt day and night
The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
Begins his golden progress in the east.
With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
By that time will our book
Do so;
And those musicians that shall play to you
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
Come
Go
The music plays
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
By'r lady
Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
altogether governed by humours. Lie still
I had rather hear Lady
Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
No.
Then be still.
Neither;'tis a woman's fault.
Now God help thee!
To the Welsh lady's bed.
What's that?
Peace! she sings.
Here the lady sings a Welsh song
Come
Not mine
Not yours
comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you
'as true as I live
'as sure as day
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths

And such protest of pepper-gingerbread

Enter KING HENRY IV
Lords
Must have some private conference; but be near at hand
Exeunt Lords
I know not whether God will have it so
He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
But thou dost in thy passages of life
Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else
And hold their level with thy princely heart?
So please your majesty
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal:
Yet such extenuation let me beg
Hath faulty wander'd and irregular
God pardon thee! yet let me wonder
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
Which by thy younger brother is supplied
Of all the court and princes of my blood:
The hope and expectation of thy time
Is ruin'd
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
Had I so lavish of my presence been
And left me in reputeless banishment
By being seldom seen
But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
Others would say 'Where
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven
That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
My presence
And won by rareness such solemnity.

With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
And gave his countenance
Of every beardless vain comparative

To loathe the taste of sweetness
More than a little is by much too much.
So when he had occasion to be seen
As
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down
As cloudy men use to their adversaries
And in that very line
For thou has lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation: not an eye
But is a-weary of thy common sight
Which now doth that I would not have it do
I shall hereafter
For all the world
As thou art to this hour was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh
Now
Than thou the shadow of succession;
For of no right
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
What never-dying honour hath he got
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
Thrice hath this Hotspur
Discomfited great Douglas
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
And what say you to this? Percy
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
Why
Thou that art like enough
To fight against me under Percy's pay
Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
I will redeem all this on Percy's head
And in the closing of some glorious day
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
When I will wear a garment all of blood
And stain my favours in a bloody mask
And that shall be the day
For every honour sitting on his helm
My shames redoubled! for the time will come
His glorious deeds for my indignities.
Percy is but my factor
And I will call him to so strict account
This
The which if He be pleased I shall perform
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
If not
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.

But I will beard him.

What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
These letters come from your father.
Letters from him! why comes he not himself?

In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
Under whose government come they along?
His letters bear his mind

He did
And at the time of my departure thence
He was much fear'd by his physicians.
I would the state of time had first been whole
Ere he by sickness had been visited:
His health was never better worth than now.
Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
The very life-blood of our enterprise;
'Tis catching hither
He writes me here
And that his friends by deputation could not
So soon be drawn
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
On any soul removed but on his own.
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement
For
Because the king is certainly possess'd
Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
A perilous gash
And yet
Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
To set the exact wealth of all our states
All at one cast? to set so rich a main
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
It were not good; for therein should we read
The very bottom and the soul of hope
Of all our fortunes.
'Faith
Where now remains a sweet reversion:
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
Is to come in:
A comfort of retirement lives in this.

Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
But yet I would your father had been here.
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division: it will be thought
By some
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
And think how such an apprehension
May turn the tide of fearful faction
And breed a kind of question in our cause;
For well you know we of the offering side
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
This absence of your father's draws a curtain
Before not dreamt of.
You strain too far.
I rather of his absence make this use:
It lends a lustre and more great opinion
To push against a kingdom
We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
Yet all goes well
As heart can think: there is not such a word
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.

He shall be welcome too. Where is his son
All furnish'd
All plumed like estridges that with the wind
Baited like eagles having lately bathed;
Glittering in golden coats
As full of spirit as the month of May
Wanton as youthful goats
I saw young Harry
Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
No more
They come like sacrifices in their trim
All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
And yet not ours. Come
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
Harry to Harry shall
O that Glendower were come!
There is more news:
I learn'd in Worcester
That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
Ay
What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
To thirty thousand.
Forty let it be:
My father and Glendower being both away
Come
Doomsday is near; die all
Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
Exeunt

If I be not ashamed of my soldiers

I have got
soldiers
none but good house-holders
me out contracted bachelors
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
toasts-and-butter
bigger than pins' heads
their services; and now my whole charge consists of
ancients
companies
painted cloth

discarded unjust serving-men
younger brothers
trade-fallen

the rooms of them that have bought out their
services
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
swine-keeping
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
Coventry with them
villains march wide betwixt the legs
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt
the truth
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.
Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND
How now
What

cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
at Shrewsbury.
Faith

Tut

I think
already made thee butter. But tell me
fellows are these that come after?
Mine
I did never see such pitiful rascals.
Tut

tush
Ay
and bare

learned that of me.
No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
the ribs bare. But

Well
Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
Exeunt
SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
Enter HOTSPUR
We'll fight with him to-night.
It may not be.
You give him then the advantage.
Not a whit.
Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
So do we.
His is certain
Good cousin
Do not
You do not counsel well:
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
Do me no slander
As you
Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
Which of us fears.
Yea
Content.
To-night
Come
Drag back our expedition: certain horse
Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;
And now their pride and mettle is asleep
So are the horses of the enemy
In general
The better part of ours are full of rest.
The number of the king exceedeth ours:
For God's sake. cousin
The trumpet sounds a parley
Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT
I come with gracious offers from the king
Welcome
You were of our determination!
Some of us love you well; and even those some
Envy your great deservings and good name
And God defend but still I should stand so
You stand against anointed majesty.
But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
The nature of your griefs
You conjure from the breast of civil peace
Such bold hostility
Audacious cruelty. If that the king
Have any way your good deserts forgot
You shall have your desires with interest
And pardon absolute for yourself and these
Herein misled by your suggestion.
The king is kind; and well we know the king
Knows at what time to promise
My father and my uncle and myself
Did give him that same royalty he wears;
And when he was not six and twenty strong
And when he heard him swear and vow to God
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster
Now when the lords and barons of the realm
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him
Met him in boroughs
Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
He presently
Made to my father
And now
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth
Over his country's wrongs; and by this face
The hearts of all that he did angle for;
Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
Of all the favourites that the absent king
In deputation left behind him here
Tut
Then to the point.
In short time after
Soon after that
And in the neck of that
To make that worse
Disgraced me in my happy victories
Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
Broke oath on oath
This head of safety; and withal to pry
Into his title
Too indirect for long continuance.
Shall I return this answer to the king?
Not so
Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
Some surety for a safe return again
Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
I would you would accept of grace and love.
And may be so we shall.
Pray God you do.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL
Hie
With winged haste to the lord marshal;
This to my cousin Scroop
To whom they are directed. If you knew
How much they do to import
My good lord
Like enough you do.
To-morrow
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
Must bide the touch; for
Meets with Lord Harry: and
And comes not in
To wage an instant trial with the king.
Why
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
No
But there is Mordake
Of gallant warriors
And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
The special head of all the land together:
The Prince of Wales
And moe corrivals and dear men
Of estimation and command in arms.
Doubt not
I hope no less
And
For if Lord Percy thrive not
Dismiss his power
Therefore make haste. I must go write again
To other friends; and so farewell
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.
Enter KING HENRY
How bloodily the sun begins to peer
Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
At his distemperature.
The southern wind
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes
Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
Then with the losers let it sympathize
The trumpet sounds
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
How now
That you and I should meet upon such terms
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust
This is not well
What say you to it? will you again unknit
This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
And move in that obedient orb again
Where you did give a fair and natural light
Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
Hear me
For mine own part
To entertain the lag-end of my life
With quiet hours; for I do protest
You have not sought it! how comes it
Rebellion lay in his way
Peace
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
Of favour from myself and all our house;
And yet I must remember you
For you my staff of office did I break
In Richard's time; and posted day and night
to meet you on the way
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
It was myself
The dangers of the time. You swore to us
Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right
To this we swore our aid. But in short space
It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
And such a flood of greatness fell on you
So long in his unlucky Irish wars
That all in England did repute him dead:
And from this swarm of fair advantages
You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
To gripe the general sway into your hand;
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
And being fed by us you used us so
As that ungentle hull
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
That even our love durst not come near your sight
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
We were enforced
Out of sight and raise this present head;
Whereby we stand opposed by such means
As you yourself have forged against yourself
By unkind usage
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
These things indeed you have articulate
With some fine colour that may please the eye
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents
Of hurlyburly innovation:
And never yet did insurrection want
Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
Nor moody beggars
Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
In both your armies there is many a soul
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter
In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes
To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
For my part
And so I hear he doth account me too;
Yet this before my father's majesty--
I am content that he shall take the odds
Of his great name and estimation
And
Do make against it. No
That are misled upon your cousin's part;
And
Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
So tell your cousin
What he will do: but if he will not yield
And they shall do their office. So
We will not now be troubled with reply:
We offer fair; take it advisedly.
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON
It will not be accepted
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
Are confident against the world in arms.
Hence
For
And God befriend us
Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF
Hal
me
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
Say thy prayers
I  would 'twere bed-time
Why
Exit PRINCE HENRY
'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
his day. What need I be so forward with him that
calls not on me? Well
me on. Yea
come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
Honour hath no skill in surgery
honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible
no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
ends my catechism.
Exit
SCENE II. The rebel camp.
Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
O
'Twere best he did.
Then are we all undone.
It is not possible
He will suspect us still and find a time
To punish this offence in other faults:
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
For treason is but trusted like the fox
Look how we can
My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
All his offences live upon my head
And on his father's; we did train him on
Therefore
Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
Here comes your cousin.
Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS
My uncle is return'd:
Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
Uncle
The king will bid you battle presently.
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
Lord Douglas
Marry
Exit
There is no seeming mercy in the king.
Did you beg any? God forbid!
I told him gently of our grievances
He calls us rebels
With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS
Arm
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king
O
But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me
No
Did hear a challenge urged more modestly
To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
He gave you all the duties of a man;
Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue
By still dispraising praise valued in you;
And
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
As if he master'd there a double spirit.
Of teaching and of learning instantly.
There did he pause: but let me tell the world
Cousin
On his follies: never did I hear
Of any prince so wild a libertine.
But be he as he will
I will embrace him with a soldier's arm
Arm
Than I
Enter a Messenger
My lord
I cannot read them now.
O gentlemen
To spend that shortness basely were too long
An if we live
If die
Now
Enter another Messenger
My lord
I thank him
Let each man do his best: and here draw I
A sword
With the best blood that I can meet withal
In the adventure of this perilous day.
Now
Sound all the lofty instruments of war
For
A second time do such a courtesy.
The trumpets sound. They embrace
SCENE III. Plain between the camps.
KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT
What is thy name
Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
Upon my head?
Know then
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king.
They tell thee true.
The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
Thy likeness
I was not born a yielder
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Lord Stafford's death.
They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR
O Douglas
All's done
Where?
Here.
This
A gallant knight he was
Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
A fool go with thy soul
A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
The king hath many marching in his coats.
Now
I'll murder all his wardrobe
Up
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
Exeunt
Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London
the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.
Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
lead
need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
they are for the town's end
But who comes here?
Enter PRINCE HENRY
What
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies
O Hal
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
done this day. I have paid Percy
He is
Nay
not my sword; but take my pistol
Give it to me: what
Ay
PRINCE HENRY draws it out
What
He throws the bottle at him. Exit
Well
come in my way
willingly
not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
life: which if I can save
unlooked for
Exit FALSTAFF
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY
I prithee
Lord John of Lancaster
Not I
I beseech your majesty
I will do so.
My Lord of Westmoreland
Come
Lead me
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this
We breathe too long: come
Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND
By God
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
Before
But now
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
With lustier maintenance than I did look for
Of such an ungrown warrior.
O
Lends mettle to us all!
Exit
Enter DOUGLAS
Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
I am the Douglas
That wear those colours on them: what art thou
The king himself; who
So many of his shadows thou hast met
And not the very king. I have two boys
Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
But
I fear thou art another counterfeit;
And yet
But mine I am sure thou art
They fight. KING HENRY being in danger
Hold up thy head
Never to hold it up again! the spirits
Of valiant Shirley
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
They fight: DOUGLAS flies
Cheerly
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent
Stay
Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion
O God! they did me too much injury
That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
If it were so
The insulting hand of Douglas over you
As all the poisonous potions in the world
And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
Exit
Enter HOTSPUR
If I mistake not
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
My name is Harry Percy.
Why
A very valiant rebel of the name.
I am the Prince of Wales; and think not
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
Nor can one England brook a double reign
Nor shall it
To end the one of us; and would to God
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
And all the budding honours on thy crest
I'll crop
I can no longer brook thy vanities.
They fight
Enter FALSTAFF
Well said
boy's play here
Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF
O
I better brook the loss of brittle life
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
But thought's the slave of life
And time
Lies on my tongue: no
And food for--
Dies
For worms
Ill-weaved ambition
When that this body did contain a spirit
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
If thou wert sensible of courtesy
But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
And
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
Adieu
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground
What
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack
I could have better spared a better man:
O
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day
Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
Exit PRINCE HENRY
[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day
to-morrow. 'Sblood
that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
Counterfeit? I lie
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
but to counterfeit dying
liveth
perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
valour is discretion; in the which better part I
have saved my life.'Zounds
gunpowder Percy
should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith
afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
Therefore I'll make him sure; yea
killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
Nothing confutes me but eyes
Therefore
with a new wound in your thigh
Takes up HOTSPUR on his back
Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER
Come
Thy maiden sword.
But
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
I did; I saw him dead
thou alive?
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
I prithee
Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
No
be not Jack Falstaff
Throwing the body down
if your father will do me any honour
him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
earl or duke
Why
Didst thou? Lord
lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
believed
valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
it upon my death
thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
This is the strangest fellow
Come
For my part
A retreat is sounded
The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
Come
Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER
I'll follow
rewards me
live cleanly as a nobleman should do.
Exit
SCENE V. Another part of the field.
The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
Three knights upon our party slain to-day
Had been alive this hour
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
What I have done my safety urged me to;
And I embrace this fortune patiently
Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
Other offenders we will pause upon.
Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON
How goes the field?
The noble Scot
The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him
Upon the foot of fear
And falling from a hill
That the pursuers took him. At my tent
The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
I may dispose of him.
With all my heart.
Then
This honourable bounty shall belong:
Go to the Douglas
Up to his pleasure
His valour shown upon our crests to-day
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
I thank your grace for this high courtesy
Then this remains
You
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed
Myself and you
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway
And since this business so fair is done
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. Westminster Abbey.
Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the  Fifth
Hung be the heavens with black
Comets
That have consented unto Henry's death!
King Henry the Fifth
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
England ne'er had a king until his time.
Virtue he had
His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
His sparking eyes
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
Henry is dead and never shall revive:
Upon a wooden coffin we attend
We with our stately presence glorify
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
Conjurers and sorcerers
By magic verses have contrived his end?
BISHOP
He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd
None do you like but an effeminate prince
BISHOP
Gloucester
And lookest to command the prince and realm.
Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe
Name not religion
Except it be to pray against thy foes.
Cease
Let's to the altar: heralds
Instead of gold
Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.
Posterity
Henry the Fifth
Prosper this realm
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
Than Julius Caesar or bright--
Enter a Messenger
My honourable lords
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France
Guienne
What say'st thou
Speak softly
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?
If Henry were recall'd to life again
How were they lost? what treachery was used?
No treachery; but want of men and money.
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered
One would have lingering wars with little cost;
Another would fly swift
A third thinks
Awake
Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:
Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
Of England's coat one half is cut away.
Were our tears wanting to this funeral
Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes
Enter to them another Messenger
Lords
France is revolted from the English quite
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;
Reignier
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.
The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
O
We will not fly
Bedford
Gloucester
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts
Enter another Messenger
My gracious lords
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
BISHOP
What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?
O
The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord
By three and twenty thousand of the French
Was round encompassed and set upon.
No leisure had he to enrank his men;
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
They pitched in the ground confusedly
More than three hours the fight continued;
Where valiant Talbot above human thought
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
Hundreds he sent to hell
Here
The French exclaim'd
All the whole army stood agazed on him:
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
He
With purpose to relieve and follow them
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;
Enclosed were they with their enemies:
A base Walloon
Durst not presume to look once in the face.
Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself
O no
Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.
His ransom there is none but I shall pay:
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
Farewell
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take
So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;
The English army is grown weak and faint:
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply
Remember
I do remember it; and here take my leave
Exit
I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
Exit
To Eltham will I
Exit
BISHOP
Each hath his place and function to attend:
I am left out; for me nothing remains.
But long I will not be Jack out of office:
The king from Eltham I intend to steal
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.
Exeunt
SCENE II. France. Before Orleans.
Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES
Mars his true moving
So in the earth
Late did he shine upon the English side;
Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
What towns of any moment but we have?
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
Otherwhiles the famish'd English
They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:
Either they must be dieted like mules
And have their provender tied to their mouths
Or piteous they will look
Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
Talbot is taken
Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;
And he may well in fretting spend his gall
Sound
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
Him I forgive my death that killeth me
When he sees me go back one foot or fly.
Exeunt
Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES
Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled
Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
He fighteth as one weary of his life.
The other lords
Froissart
More truly now may this be verified;
For none but Samsons and Goliases
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
Lean
They had such courage and audacity?
Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
I think
Their arms are set like clocks
Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
By my consent
Be it so.
Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
Bastard of Orleans
Methinks your looks are sad
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
Be not dismay'd
A holy maid hither with me I bring
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath
What's past and what's to come she can descry.
Speak
Go
Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS
But first
Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
Fair maid
Reignier
Where is the Dauphin? Come
I know thee well
Be not amazed
In private will I talk with thee apart.
Stand back
She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
Dauphin
Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
To shine on my contemptible estate:
Lo
And in a vision full of majesty
Will'd me to leave my base vocation
And free my country from calamity:
Her aid she promised and assured success:
In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
And
That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
Ask me what question thou canst possible
My courage try by combat
Resolve on this
Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
Only this proof I'll of thy valour make
Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword
The which at Touraine
churchyard
Then come
And while I live
Here they fight
Stay
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
Christ's mother helps me
Whoe'er helps thee
Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
Excellent Pucelle
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
I must not yield to any rites of love
When I have chased all thy foes from hence
Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
My lord
Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
Shall we disturb him
He may mean more than we poor men do know:
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
My lord
Shall we give over Orleans
Why
Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
Expect Saint Martin's summer
Glory is like a circle in the water
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
With Henry's death the English circle ends;
Dispersed are the glories it included.
Now am I like that proud insulting ship
Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.
Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
Helen
Bright star of Venus
Leave off delays
Woman
Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.
Presently we'll try: come
No prophet will I trust
Exeunt
SCENE III. London. Before the Tower.
Enter GLOUCESTER
I am come to survey the Tower this day:
Since Henry's death
Where be these warders
Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.
[Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?
"First Serving-Man	It is the noble Duke of Gloucester."
[Within]  Whoe'er he be
"First Serving-Man	Villains"
[Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him:
We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?
There's none protector of the realm but I.
Break up the gates
Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates
What noise is this? what traitors have we here?
Lieutenant
Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.
Have patience
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:
From him I have express commandment
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
Faint-hearted Woodvile
Arrogant Winchester
Thou art no friend to God or to the king:
Open the gates
"Serving-Men	Open the gates unto the lord protector"
Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats
BISHOP
How now
Peel'd priest
BISHOP
I do
Stand back
Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:
I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat
BISHOP
Nay
This be Damascus
I will not slay thee
Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
I'll use to carry thee out of this place.
BISHOP
Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.
What! am I dared and bearded to my face?
Draw
Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest
Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:
In spite of pope or dignities of church
BISHOP
Gloucester
Winchester goose
Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?
Thee I'll chase hence
Out
Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF  WINCHESTER's men
Fie
Peace
Here's Beaufort
BISHOP
Here's Gloucester
I will not answer thee with words
Here they skirmish again
Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife
But to make open proclamation:
Come
All manner of men assembled here in arms this day
against God's peace and the king's
command you
your several dwelling-places; and not to wear
Cardinal
But we shall meet
BISHOP
Gloucester
Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.
I'll call for clubs
This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
Mayor
BISHOP
Abominable Gloucester
For I intend to have it ere long.
Exeunt
See the coast clear'd
Good God
I myself fight not once in forty year.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Orleans.
Enter
"Master-Gunner	Sirrah"
Father
"Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:"
Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
Something I must do to procure me grace.
The prince's espials have informed me
How the English
In yonder tower
They may vex us with shot
To intercept this inconvenience
And even these three days have I watch'd
Now do thou watch
If thou spy'st any
And thou shalt find me at the governor's.
Exit
Father
I'll never trouble you
Exit
Enter
Talbot
How wert thou handled being prisoner?
Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
Discourse
The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
For him was I exchanged and ransomed.
But with a baser man of arms by far
Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
Which I
In fine
But
Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
In open market-place produced they me
Here
Then broke I from the officers that led me
My grisly countenance made others fly;
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
And if I did but stir out of my bed
Enter the Boy with a linstock
I grieve to hear what torments you endured
Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
Here
and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:
Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
Sir Thomas Gargrave
Where is best place to make our battery next.
I think
And I
For aught I see
Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall
O Lord
O Lord
What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
Speak
How farest thou
One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
That hath contrived this woful tragedy!
In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
Whilst any trump did sound
Yet livest thou
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
Heaven
Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
Sir Thomas Gargrave
Speak unto Talbot; nay
Salisbury
Thou shalt not die whiles--
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
As who should say 'When I am dead and gone
Plantagenet
Wretched shall France be only in my name.
Here an alarum
What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
Enter a Messenger
My lord
The Dauphin
Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans
Hear
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
Frenchmen
Pucelle or puzzel
Convey me Salisbury into his tent
Alarum. Exeunt
SCENE V. The same.
Here an alarum again: and TALBOT pursueth the  DAUPHIN
Where is my strength
Our English troops retire
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
Here
Devil or devil's dam
Blood will I draw on thee
Come
Here they fight
Heavens
My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.
But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.
They fight again
Talbot
I must go victual Orleans forthwith.
A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers
O'ertake me
Go
Help Salisbury to make his testament:
This day is ours
Exit
My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;
I know not where I am
A witch
So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
Are from their hives and houses driven away.
They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;
Now
A short alarum
Hark
Renounce your soil
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf
Alarum. Here another skirmish
It will not be: retire into your trenches:
You all consented unto Salisbury's death
Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans
O
The shame hereof will make me hide my head.
Exit TALBOT. Alarum; retreat; flourish
SCENE VI. The same.
Enter
Advance our waving colours on the walls;
Rescued is Orleans from the English
Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.
Divinest creature
Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens
That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.
France
Recover'd is the town of Orleans:
More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.
Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?
Dauphin
And feast and banquet in the open streets
All France will be replete with mirth and joy
'Tis Joan
For which I will divide my crown with her
Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:
In memory of her when she is dead
Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius
Before the kings and queens of France.
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry
Come in
Flourish. Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. Before Orleans.
Enter a Sergeant of a band with two Sentinels
Sirs
If any noise or soldier you perceive
Near to the walls
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.
Sergeant
Exit Sergeant
Thus are poor servitors
Enter TALBOT
Lord Regent
Embrace we then this opportunity
As fitting best to quittance their deceit
Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.
Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame
Traitors have never other company.
But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?
A maid
A maid! and be so martial!
Pray God she prove not masculine ere long
She carry armour as she hath begun.
Well
God is our fortress
Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.
Ascend
Not all together: better far
That
Agreed: I'll to yond corner.
And I to this.
And here will Talbot mount
Now
Of English Henry
How much in duty I am bound to both.
Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!
Cry: 'St. George
The French leap over the walls in their shirts.  Enter
How now
Unready! ay
'Twas time
Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms
More venturous or desperate than this.
I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
If not of hell
Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
Tut
Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE
Is this thy cunning
Didst thou at first
Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!
At all times will you have my power alike?
Sleeping or waking must I still prevail
Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good
Duke of Alencon
Had all your quarters been as safely kept
As that whereof I had the government
Mine was secure.
And so was mine
And
I was employ'd in passing to and fro
Then how or which way should they first break in?
Question
But weakly guarded
And now there rests no other shift but this;
To gather our soldiers
Alarum. Enter an English Soldier
I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;
For I have loaden me with many spoils
Exit
SCENE II. Orleans. Within the town.
Enter TALBOT
The day begins to break
Here sound retreat
Retreat sounded
Bring forth the body of old Salisbury
Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;
For every drop of blood was drawn from him
And that hereafter ages may behold
What ruin happen'd in revenge of him
A tomb
Upon the which
And what a terror he had been to France.
But
'Tis thought
Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
Myself
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night
That could not live asunder day or night.
After that things are set in order here
Enter a Messenger
All hail
Call ye the warlike Talbot
So much applauded through the realm of France?
Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
The virtuous lady
To visit her poor castle where she lies
Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
Is it even so? Nay
Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport
You may not
Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
Could not prevail with all their oratory
And therefore tell her I return great thanks
Will not your honours bear me company?
No
And I have heard it said
Are often welcomest when they are gone.
Well then
Come hither
Whispers
You perceive my mind?
I do
Exeunt
SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle.
Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter
COUNTESS
Porter
And when you have done so
Madam
Exit
COUNTESS
The plot is laid: if all things fall out right
As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
Enter Messenger and TALBOT
Madam
COUNTESS
And he is welcome. What! is this the man?
Madam
COUNTESS
Is this the scourge of France?
Is this the Talbot
That with his name the mothers still their babes?
I see report is fabulous and false:
I thought I should have seen some Hercules
Alas
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies.
Madam
But since your ladyship is not at leisure
COUNTESS
What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.
Stay
To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
Marry
Re-enter Porter with keys
COUNTESS
If thou be he
Prisoner! to whom?
COUNTESS
To me
And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
But now the substance shall endure the like
Wasted our country
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
Ha
COUNTESS
Laughest thou
I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
Whereon to practise your severity.
COUNTESS
Why
I am indeed.
COUNTESS
Then have I substance too.
No
You are deceived
For what you see is but the smallest part
And least proportion of humanity:
I tell you
COUNTESS
This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;
He will be here
How can these contrarieties agree?
That will I show you presently.
Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers
How say you
That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
These are his substance
And in a moment makes them desolate.
COUNTESS
Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
For I am sorry that with reverence
I did not entertain thee as thou art.
Be not dismay'd
The mind of Talbot
The outward composition of his body.
What you have done hath not offended me;
Nor other satisfaction do I crave
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;
For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.
COUNTESS
With all my heart
To feast so great a warrior in my house.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. London. The Temple-garden.
Enter the Earls of SOMERSET
RICHARD
Great lords and gentlemen
Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;
The garden here is more convenient.
RICHARD
Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;
Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
Faith
And therefore frame the law unto my will.
Judge you
Between two hawks
Between two dogs
Between two blades
Between two horses
Between two girls
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law
RICHARD
Tut
The truth appears so naked on my side
That any purblind eye may find it out.
And on my side it is so well apparell'd
That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
RICHARD
Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak
Let him that is a true-born gentleman
And stands upon the honour of his birth
Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
I love no colours
Of base insinuating flattery
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
And say withal I think he held the right.
Stay
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
Good Master Vernon
If I have fewest
RICHARD
And I.
Then for the truth and plainness of the case.
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
Prick not your finger as you pluck it off
And fall on my side so
If I my lord
And keep me on the side where still I am.
Well
Unless my study and my books be false
To SOMERSET
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
RICHARD
Now
Here in my scabbard
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
RICHARD
Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;
For pale they look with fear
The truth on our side.
No
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
RICHARD
Hath not thy rose a canker
Hath not thy rose a thorn
RICHARD
Ay
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
Well
RICHARD
Now
Turn not thy scorns this way
RICHARD
Proud Pole
I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
Away
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
Now
His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence
Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
RICHARD
He bears him on the place's privilege
By him that made me
On any plot of ground in Christendom.
Was not thy father
And
His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
And
RICHARD
My father was attached
And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset
For your partaker Pole and you yourself
Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.
Ah
And know us by these colours for thy foes
RICHARD
And
Or flourish to the height of my degree.
Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!
And so farewell until I meet thee next.
Exit
Have with thee
Exit
RICHARD
How I am braved and must perforce endure it!
This blot that they object against your house
Shall be wiped out in the next parliament
Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
And if thou be not then created York
Meantime
And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
RICHARD
Good Master Vernon
In your behalf still will I wear the same.
And so will I.
RICHARD
Thanks
Come
This quarrel will drink blood another day.
Exeunt
SCENE V. The Tower of London.
Enter MORTIMER
Kind keepers of my weak decaying age
Even like a man new haled from the rack
And these grey locks
These eyes
Weak shoulders
That droops his sapless branches to the ground;
Yet are these feet
But tell me
Richard Plantagenet
We sent unto the Temple
And answer was return'd that he will come.
Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign
And even since then hath Richard been obscured
But now the arbitrator of despairs
I would his troubles likewise were expired
Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET
My lord
Richard Plantagenet
RICHARD
Ay
Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck
O
And now declare
RICHARD
First
And
This day
Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
And did upbraid me with my father's death:
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue
Therefore
And for alliance sake
My father
That cause
And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
Within a loathsome dungeon
RICHARD
Discover more at large what cause that was
I will
And death approach not ere my tale be done.
Henry the Fourth
During whose reign the Percies of the north
The reason moved these warlike lords to this
Was
I was the next by birth and parentage;
For by my mother I derived am
From Lionel Duke of Clarence
To King Edward the Third; whereas he
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree
But mark: as in this haughty attempt
They laboured to plant the rightful heir
Long after this
From famous Edmund Langley
Levied an army
And have install'd me in the diadem:
But
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers
RICHARD
Of which
True; and thou seest that I no issue have
And that my fainting words do warrant death;
Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:
But yet be wary in thy studious care.
RICHARD
Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:
But yet
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
With silence
Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster
But now thy uncle is removing hence:
As princes do their courts
With long continuance in a settled place.
RICHARD
O
Might but redeem the passage of your age!
Thou dost then wrong me
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
Mourn not
Only give order for my funeral:
And so farewell
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!
Dies
RICHARD
And peace
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
Well
And what I do imagine let that rest.
Keepers
Will see his burial better than his life.
Exeunt Gaolers
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer
And for those wrongs
I doubt not but with honour to redress;
And therefore haste I to the parliament
Exit
ACT III
SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI
BISHOP
Comest thou with deep premeditated lines
As I with sudden and extemporal speech
Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience
Think not
The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:
No
Thou art a most pernicious usurer
Lascivious
A man of thy profession and degree;
And for thy treachery
In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life
Beside
From envious malice of thy swelling heart.
BISHOP
Gloucester
To give me hearing what I shall reply.
If I were covetous
Or how haps it I seek not to advance
Or raise myself
And for dissension
More than I do?--except I be provoked.
No
It is not that that hath incensed the duke:
It is
No one but he should be about the king;
And that engenders thunder in his breast
And makes him roar these accusations forth.
But he shall know I am as good--
As good!
Thou bastard of my grandfather!
BISHOP
Ay
Am I not protector
BISHOP
And am not I a prelate of the church?
Yes
And useth it to patronage his theft.
BISHOP
Unreverent Gloster!
Thou art reverent
Touching thy spiritual function
BISHOP
Rome shall remedy this.
Roam thither
My lord
Ay
Methinks my lord should be religious
And know the office that belongs to such.
Methinks his lordship should be humbler;
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
Yes
State holy or unhallow'd
Is not his grace protector to the king?
RICHARD
[Aside]  Plantagenet
Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'
Else would I have a fling at Winchester.
Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester
O
Believe me
Civil dissension is a viperous worm
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
A noise within
What tumult's this?
An uproar
A noise again
O
The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men
And banding themselves in contrary parts
Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:
Our windows are broke down in every street
And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
Enter Serving-men
We charge you
Pray
"First Serving-man	Nay"
"Second Serving-man	Do what ye dare"
Skirmish again
You of my household
And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
"Third Serving-man	My lord"
Just and upright; and
And ere that we will suffer such a prince
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
"First Serving-man	Ay"
Shall pitch a field when we are dead.
Begin again
Stay
And if you love me
O
Can you
My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
Who should be pitiful
Or who should study to prefer a peace.
If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
Yield
Except you mean with obstinate repulse
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
You see what mischief and what murder too
Hath been enacted through your enmity;
Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.
BISHOP
He shall submit
Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
Or I would see his heart out
Should ever get that privilege of me.
Behold
Hath banish'd moody discontented fury
Why look you still so stern and tragical?
Here
Fie
That malice was a great and grievous sin;
And will not you maintain the thing you teach
Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.
For shame
What
BISHOP
Well
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
[Aside]  Ay
See here
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:
So help me God
BISHOP
[Aside]  So help me God
O
Away
But join in friendship
"First Serving-man	Content: I'll to the surgeon's."
"Second Serving-man	And so will I."
"Third Serving-man	And I will see what physic the tavern affords."
Exeunt Serving-men
Accept this scroll
We do exhibit to your majesty.
Well urged
Especially for those occasions
At Eltham Place I told your majesty.
And those occasions
Therefore
That Richard be restored to his blood.
Let Richard be restored to his blood;
So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.
BISHOP
As will the rest
If Richard will be true
But all the whole inheritance I give
That doth belong unto the house of York
RICHARD
Thy humble servant vows obedience
And humble service till the point of death.
Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;
And
Rise Richard
RICHARD
And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
And as my duty springs
That grudge one thought against your majesty!
Welcome
[Aside]  Perish
Now will it best avail your majesty
To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:
The presence of a king engenders love
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
When Gloucester says the word
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
Your ships already are in readiness.
Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER
Ay
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
And will at last break out into a flame:
As fester'd members rot but by degree
And now I fear that fatal prophecy
Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
And Henry born at Windsor lose all:
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
His days may finish ere that hapless time.
Exit
SCENE II. France. Before Rouen.
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised
These are the city gates
Take heed
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
That come to gather money for their corn.
If we have entrance
Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city
Therefore we'll knock.
Knocks
[Within]  Qui est la?
Paysans
Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.
Enter
Now
Exeunt
Enter CHARLES
Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.
Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;
Now she is there
Where is the best and safest passage in?
By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;
Which
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top
Behold
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen
Exit
See
The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
Now shine it like a comet of revenge
Defer no time

An alarum: excursions. BEDFORD
Good morrow
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
Before he'll buy again at such a rate:
'Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?
Scoff on
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.
Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.
O
What will you do
Foul fiend of France
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
Damsel
Are ye so hot
If Talbot do but thunder
The English whisper together in council
God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?
Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
Belike your lordship takes us then for fools
I speak not to that railing Hecate
Will ye
Signior
Signior
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
Away
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
God be wi' you
That we are here.
Exeunt from the walls
And there will we be too
Vow
And I
And as his father here was conqueror
Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried
My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
But
Lord Talbot
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
And will be partner of your weal or woe.
Courageous Bedford
Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
Came to the field and vanquished his foes:
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts
Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!
And now no more ado
And set upon our boasting enemy.
Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants
An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and a Captain
Whither away
Whither away! to save myself by flight:
We are like to have the overthrow again.
What! will you fly
Ay
Exit
Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!
Exit
Retreat: excursions. JOAN LA PUCELLE
Now
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
They that of late were daring with their scoffs
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.
BEDFORD dies
An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT
Lost
This is a double honour
Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
Warlike and martial Talbot
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.
Thanks
I think her old familiar is asleep:
Now where's the Bastard's braves
What
That such a valiant company are fled.
Now will we take some order in the town
What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
But yet
The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased
A braver soldier never couched lance
But kings and mightiest potentates must die
Exeunt
SCENE III. The plains near Rouen.
Enter CHARLES
Dismay not
Care is no cure
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
We'll pull his plumes and take away his train
We have been guided by thee hitherto
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
Search out thy wit for secret policies
We'll set thy statue in some holy place
Employ thee then
Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:
By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
To leave the Talbot and to follow us.
Ay
Nor should that nation boast it so with us
For ever should they be expulsed from France
And not have title of an earldom here.
Your honours shall perceive how I will work
To bring this matter to the wished end.
Drum sounds afar off
Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.
Here sound an English march. Enter
There goes the Talbot
French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces
Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
Summon a parley; we will talk with him.
Trumpets sound a parley
A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!
Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
The princely Charles of France
What say'st thou
Speak
Brave Burgundy
Stay
Speak on; but be not over-tedious.
Look on thy country
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
As looks the mother on her lowly babe
When death doth close his tender dying eyes
Behold the wounds
O
Strike those that hurt
One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears
Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words
Besides
Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
When Talbot hath set footing once in France
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
Call we to mind
And was he not in England prisoner?
But when they heard he was thine enemy
See
And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
Come
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot
Forgive me
My forces and my power of men are yours:
So farewell
[Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn
Welcome
And doth beget new courage in our breasts.
Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this
Now let us on
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Paris. The palace.
Enter KING HENRY VI
My gracious prince
In sign
To your obedience fifty fortresses
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
First to my God and next unto your grace.
Kneels
Is this the Lord Talbot
Yes
Welcome
When I was young
A stouter champion never handled sword.
Long since we were resolved of your truth
Yet never have you tasted our reward
Therefore
And in our coronation take your place.
Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET
Now
In honour of my noble Lord of York:
Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?
Yes
The envious barking of your saucy tongue
Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.
Sirrah
Why
Hark ye; not so: in witness
Strikes him
Villain
That whoso draws a sword
But I'll unto his majesty
I may have liberty to venge this wrong;
When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.
Well
And
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. Paris. A hall of state.
Enter KING HENRY VI
Lord bishop
BISHOP
God save King Henry
Now
Esteem none friends but such as are his friends
Malicious practises against his state:
This shall ye do
Enter FASTOLFE
My gracious sovereign
Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
I vow'd
Which I have done
Thou wast installed in that high degree.
Pardon me
This dastard
And that the French were almost ten to one
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
Myself and divers gentlemen beside
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.
Then judge
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
This ornament of knighthood
To say the truth
And ill beseeming any common man
When first this order was ordain'd
Not fearing death
He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.
Stain to thy countrymen
Be packing
Henceforth we banish thee
Exit FASTOLFE
And now
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.
What means his grace
No more but
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
Or doth this churlish superscription
Pretend some alteration in good will?
What's here?
Reads
'I have
Of such as your oppression feeds upon
And join'd with Charles
O monstrous treachery! can this be so
What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?
He doth
Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
It is the worst
Why
And give him chastisement for this abuse.
How say you
Content
Then gather strength and march unto him straight:
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
And what offence it is to flout his friends.
I go
You may behold confusion of your foes.
Exit
Enter VERNON and BASSET
Grant me the combat
And me
This is my servant: hear him
And this is mine: sweet Henry
Be patient
Say
And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?
With him
And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.
What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
First let me know
Crossing the sea from England into France
Saying
Did represent my master's blushing cheeks
About a certain question in the law
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;
With other vile and ignominious terms:
In confutation of which rude reproach
And in defence of my lord's worthiness
And that is my petition
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
To set a gloss upon his bold intent
And he first took exceptions at this badge
Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
Will not this malice
Your private grudge
Good Lord
Such factious emulations shall arise!
Good cousins both
Let this dissension first be tried by fight
The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
There is my pledge; accept it
Nay
Confirm it so
Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!
And perish ye
Presumptuous vassals
With this immodest clamorous outrage
To trouble and disturb the king and us?
And you
To bear with their perverse objections;
Much less to take occasion from their mouths
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:
Let me persuade you take a better course.
It grieves his highness: good my lords
Come hither
Henceforth I charge you
And you
If they perceive dissension in our looks
And that within ourselves we disagree
To wilful disobedience
Beside
That for a toy
Destroy'd themselves
O
That for a trifle that was bought with blood
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
I see no reason
That any one should therefore be suspicious
I more incline to Somerset than York:
Both are my kinsmen
As well they may upbraid me with my crown
But your discretions better can persuade
Than I am able to instruct or teach:
And therefore
Cousin of York
To be our regent in these parts of France:
And
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
And
Your angry choler on your enemies.
Ourself
After some respite will return to Calais;
From thence to England; where I hope ere long
To be presented
Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK
My Lord of York
Prettily
And so he did; but yet I like it not
Tush
I dare presume
An if I wist he did
Other affairs must now be managed.
Exeunt all but EXETER
Well didst thou
For
More rancorous spite
But howsoe'er
This jarring discord of nobility
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
But more when envy breeds unkind division;
There comes the rain
Exit
SCENE II. Before Bourdeaux.
Enter TALBOT
Go to the gates of Bourdeaux
Summon their general unto the wall.
Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others
English John Talbot
And thus he would: Open your city gates;
Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours
And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:
But
Who in a moment even with the earth
Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers
Thou ominous and fearful owl of death
The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
On us thou canst not enter but by death;
For
And strong enough to issue out and fight:
If thou retire
On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
To rive their dangerous artillery
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.
Lo
This is the latest glory of thy praise
That I
For ere the glass
Drum afar off
Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.
Exeunt General
He fables not; I hear the enemy:
Out
O
How are we park'd and bounded in a pale
If we be English deer
Not rascal-like
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:
Sell every man his life as dear as mine
God and Saint George
Exeunt
SCENE III. Plains in Gascony.
Enter a Messenger that meets YORK. Enter YORK with trumpet and many Soldiers
Are not the speedy scouts return'd again
They are return'd
That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led
A plague upon that villain Somerset
Of horsemen
Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid
And cannot help the noble chevalier:
God comfort him in this necessity!
If he miscarry
Enter Sir William LUCY
Thou princely leader of our English strength
And hemm'd about with grim destruction:
To Bourdeaux
Else
O God
Doth stop my cornets
So should we save a valiant gentleman
By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.
Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep
O
He dies
We mourn
All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.
Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;
And on his son young John
I met in travel toward his warlike father!
This seven years did not Talbot see his son;
And now they meet where both their lives are done.
Alas
To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
Away! vexation almost stops my breath
Lucy
Maine
Exit
Thus
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders
The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror
Exit
SCENE IV. Other plains in Gascony.
Enter SOMERSET
It is too late; I cannot send them now:
This expedition was by York and Talbot
Too rashly plotted: all our general force
Might with a sally of the very town
Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot
Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
By this unheedful
York set him on to fight and die in shame
Here is Sir William Lucy
Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.
Enter Sir William LUCY
How now
Whither
Who
And whiles the honourable captain there
Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs
Let not your private discord keep away
The levied succors that should lend him aid
Orleans the Bastard
York set him on; York should have sent him aid.
And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;
Swearing that you withhold his levied host
York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;
I owe him little duty
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
The fraud of England
Never to England shall he bear his life;
But dies
Come
Within six hours they will be at his aid.
Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain;
For fly he could not
And fly would Talbot never
If he be dead
His fame lives in the world
Exeunt
SCENE V. The English camp near Bourdeaux.
Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son
O young John Talbot! I did send for thee
To tutor thee in stratagems of war
When sapless age and weak unable limbs
Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
But
Now thou art come unto a feast of death
Therefore
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
By sudden flight: come
Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
And shall I fly? O if you love my mother
The world will say
Fly
He that flies so will ne'er return again.
If we both stay
Then let me stay; and
Your loss is great
My worth unknown
Upon my death the French can little boast;
In yours they will
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;
But mine it will
You fled for vantage
But
There is no hope that ever I will stay
Here on my knee I beg mortality
Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
Ay
Upon my blessing
To fight I will
Part of thy father may be saved in thee.
No part of him but will be shame in me.
Thou never hadst renown
Yes
Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
You cannot witness for me
If death be so apparent
And leave my followers here to fight and die?
My age was never tainted with such shame.
And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
No more can I be sever'd from your side
Stay
For live I will not
Then here I take my leave of thee
Come
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.
Exeunt
SCENE VI. A field of battle.
Alarum: excursions
Saint George and victory! fight
The regent hath with Talbot broke his word
And left us to the rage of France his sword.
Where is John Talbot? Pause
I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.
O
The life thou gavest me first was lost and done
When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire
Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age
The ireful bastard Orleans
From thee
Of thy first fight
Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace
Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine
Which thou didst force from Talbot
Here
Wilt thou yet leave the battle
Fly
The help of one stands me in little stead.
O
If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage
By me they nothing gain an if I stay;
'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:
In thee thy mother dies
All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.
The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;
These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:
On that advantage
And like me to the peasant boys of France
Surely
Then talk no more of flight
If son to Talbot
Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete
If thou wilt fight
And
Exeunt
SCENE VII. Another part of the field.
Alarum: excursions. Enter TALBOT led by a Servant
Where is my other life? mine own is gone;
O
Triumphant death
When he perceived me shrink and on my knee
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
But when my angry guardant stood alone
Suddenly made him from my side to start
Into the clustering battle of the French;
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
His over-mounting spirit
O
Enter Soldiers
Thou antic death
O
Brave death by speaking
Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
Poor boy! he smiles
Come
My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
Soldiers
Dies
Enter CHARLES
Had York and Somerset brought rescue in
How the young whelp of Talbot's
Once I encounter'd him
'Thou maiden youth
But
To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'
So
Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;
See
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!
Hew them to pieces
Whose life was England's glory
O
During the life
Enter Sir William LUCY
Herald
On what submissive message art thou sent?
Submission
We English warriors wot not what it means.
I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en
And to survey the bodies of the dead.
For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.
But tell me whom thou seek'st.
But where's the great Alcides of the field
Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield
Knight of the noble order of Saint George
Great marshal to Henry the Sixth
Of all his wars within the realm of France?
Here is a silly stately style indeed!
The Turk
Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.
Is Talbot slain
O
O
It were enough to fright the realm of France:
Were but his picture left amongst you here
Give me their bodies
And give them burial as beseems their worth.
I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost
For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here
Go
I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
So we be rid of them
And now to Paris
All will be ours
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. London. The palace.
Sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI
Have you perused the letters from the pope
I have
They humbly sue unto your excellence
To have a godly peace concluded of
Between the realms of England and of France.
How doth your grace affect their motion?
Well
To stop effusion of our Christian blood
And 'stablish quietness on every side.
Ay
It was both impious and unnatural
That such immanity and bloody strife
Should reign among professors of one faith.
Beside
And surer bind this knot of amity
In marriage
Marriage
And fitter is my study and my books
Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.
Yet call the ambassador; and
I shall be well content with any choice
Tends to God's glory and my country's weal.
Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER in Cardinal's habit
What! is my Lord of Winchester install'd
Then I perceive that will be verified
Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy
My lords ambassadors
Have been consider'd and debated on.
And therefore are we certainly resolved
To draw conditions of a friendly peace;
Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
Shall be transported presently to France.
And for the proffer of my lord your master
As liking of the lady's virtuous gifts
In argument and proof of which contract
And so
And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd
Commit them to the fortune of the sea.
Exeunt all but CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER and Legate
CARDINAL
Stay
The sum of money which I promised
Should be deliver'd to his holiness
For clothing me in these grave ornaments.
I will attend upon your lordship's leisure.
CARDINAL
[Aside]  Now Winchester will not submit
Humphrey of Gloucester
That
I'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee
Exeunt
SCENE II. France. Plains in Anjou.
Enter CHARLES
These news
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
And turn again unto the warlike French.
Then march to Paris
Peace be amongst them
Else
Enter Scout
Success unto our valiant general
What tidings send our scouts? I prithee
The English army
Into two parties
Somewhat too sudden
But we will presently provide for them.
I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there:
Now he is gone
Of all base passions
Command the conquest
Then on
Exeunt
SCENE III. Before Angiers.
Alarum. Excursions. Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
The regent conquers
Now help
And ye choice spirits that admonish me
And give me signs of future accidents.
Thunder
You speedy helpers
Under the lordly monarch of the north
Enter Fiends
This speedy and quick appearance argues proof
Of your accustom'd diligence to me.
Now
Out of the powerful regions under earth
They walk
O
Where I was wont to feed you with my blood
In earnest of further benefit
They hang their heads
No hope to have redress? My body shall
Pay recompense
They shake their heads
Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice
Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?
Then take my soul
They depart
See
That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest
And let her head fall into England's lap.
My ancient incantations are too weak
Now
Exit
Excursions. Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE fighting hand  to hand with YORK. JOAN LA PUCELLE is taken. The French fly.
Damsel of France
Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms
And try if they can gain your liberty.
A goodly prize
See
Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.
O
No shape but his can please your dainty eye.
A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!
And may ye both be suddenly surprised
By bloody hands
Fell banning hag
I prithee
Curse
Exeunt
Alarum. Enter SUFFOLK with MARGARET in his hand
Be what thou wilt
Gazes on her
O fairest beauty
For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;
I kiss these fingers for eternal peace
Who art thou? say
Margaret my name
An earl I am
Be not offended
So doth the swan her downy cygnets save
Yet
Go
She is going
O
My hand would free her
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams
Fain would I woo her
I'll call for pen and ink
Fie
Hast not a tongue? is she not here?
Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
Ay
Say
What ransom must I pay before I pass?
For I perceive I am thy prisoner.
How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit
Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?
She's beautiful
She is a woman
Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea
Fond man
Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
I were best to leave him
There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.
He talks at random; sure
And yet a dispensation may be had.
And yet I would that you would answer me.
I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
Why
He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
Yet so my fancy may be satisfied
But there remains a scruple in that too;
For though her father be the King of Naples
Hear ye
It shall be so
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
Madam
What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight
Lady
Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;
And then I need not crave his courtesy.
Sweet madam
Tush
Lady
I cry you mercy
Say
Your bondage happy
To be a queen in bondage is more vile
Than is a slave in base servility;
For princes should be free.
And so shall you
Why
I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen
And set a precious crown upon thy head
What?
His love.
I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
No
To woo so fair a dame to be his wife
How say you
An if my father please
Then call our captains and our colours forth.
And
We'll crave a parley
A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls
See
To whom?
To me.
Suffolk
I am a soldier
Yes
Consent
Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;
And this her easy-held imprisonment
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.
Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
Fair Margaret knows
That Suffolk doth not flatter
Upon thy princely warrant
To give thee answer of thy just demand.
Exit from the walls
And here I will expect thy coming.
Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER
Welcome
Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.
Thanks
What answer makes your grace unto my suit?
Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
To be the princely bride of such a lord;
Upon condition I may quietly
Enjoy mine own
That is her ransom; I deliver her;
And those two counties I will undertake
Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
And I again
Reignier of France
Aside
And yet
To be mine own attorney in this case.
I'll over then to England with this news
So farewell
In golden palaces
I do embrace thee
The Christian prince
Farewell
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.
Going
Farewell
No princely commendations to my king?
Such commendations as becomes a maid
Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
But madam
No loving token to his majesty?
Yes
And this withal.
Kisses her
That for thyself: I will not so presume
To send such peevish tokens to a king.
Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
O
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
Repeat their semblance often on the seas
Exit
SCENE IV. Camp of the YORK in Anjou.
Enter YORK
Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
Ah
Have I sought every country far and near
Ah
Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
I am descended of a gentler blood:
Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
Out
I did beget her
Her mother liveth yet
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.
Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?
This argues what her kind of life hath been
Fie
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:
Deny me not
Peasant
'Tis true
The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
Kneel down and take my blessing
Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
Of thy nativity! I would the milk
Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast
Or else
Dost thou deny thy father
O
Exit
Take her away; for she hath lived too long
First
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain
Virtuous and holy; chosen from above
I never had to do with wicked spirits:
But you
To compass wonders but by help of devils.
No
A virgin from her tender infancy
Whose maiden blood
Ay
And hark ye
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
Then
I am with child
Murder not then the fruit within my womb
Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!
The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
She and the Dauphin have been juggling:
I did imagine what would be her refuge.
Well
Especially since Charles must father it.
You are deceived; my child is none of his:
It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.
Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!
It dies
O
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named
A married man! that's most intolerable.
Why
It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
And yet
Strumpet
Use no entreaty
Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:
May never glorious sun reflex his beams
Upon the country where you make abode;
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
Environ you
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
Exit
Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes
Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER
CARDINAL
Lord regent
With letters of commission from the king.
For know
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
Approacheth
Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
After the slaughter of so many peers
And sold their bodies for their country's benefit
Have we not lost most part of all the towns
O Warwick
The utter loss of all the realm of France.
Be patient
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.
Enter CHARLES
Since
That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France
What the conditions of that league must be.
Speak
The hollow passage of my poison'd voice
CARDINAL
Charles
That
And Charles
To pay him tribute
Must he be then as shadow of himself?
Adorn his temples with a coronet
This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
'Tis known already that I am possess'd
With more than half the Gallian territories
Shall I
No
That which I have than
Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means
Used intercession to obtain a league
Either accept the title thou usurp'st
And not of any challenge of desert
My lord
To cavil in the course of this contract:
If once it be neglected
We shall not find like opportunity.
To say the truth
To save your subjects from such massacre
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
By our proceeding in hostility;
And therefore take this compact of a truce
How say'st thou
It shall;
Only reserved
In any of our towns of garrison.
Then swear allegiance to his majesty
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England
So
Hang up your ensign
Exeunt
SCENE V. London. The palace.
Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI
Your wondrous rare description
Her virtues graced with external gifts
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
Where I may have fruition of her love.
Tush
Is but a preface of her worthy praise;
The chief perfections of that lovely dame
Had I sufficient skill to utter them
And
She is content to be at your command;
Command
And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
Therefore
That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
So should I give consent to flatter sin.
You know
Unto another lady of esteem:
How shall we then dispense with that contract
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
Or one that
To try his strength
By reason of his adversary's odds:
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds
Why
Her father is no better than an earl
Yes
And of such great authority in France
As his alliance will confirm our peace
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do
Beside
A dower
Henry is able to enrich his queen
And not seek a queen to make him rich:
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives
Marriage is a matter of more worth
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;
Not whom we will
And therefore
For what is wedlock forced but a hell
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
Whom should we match with Henry
Her peerless feature
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
For Henry
As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
Then yield
That Margaret shall be queen
Whether it be through force of your report
My tender youth was never yet attaint
With any passion of inflaming love
Take
Agree to any covenants
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
For your expenses and sufficient charge
Be gone
And you
If you do censure me by what you were
This sudden execution of my will.
And so
Exit
Ay
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER
Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes
Margaret shall now be queen
But I will rule both her
Exit
ACT I
SCENE I. London. The palace.
Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING  HENRY VI
As by your high imperial majesty
I had in charge at my depart for France
And humbly now upon my bended knee
To your most gracious hands
Of that great shadow I did represent;
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave
Suffolk
I can express no kinder sign of love
Than this kind kiss. O Lord
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
A world of earthly blessings to my soul
Great King of England and my gracious lord
With ruder terms
And over-joy of heart doth minister.
Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech
Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
Lords
[Kneeling]  Long live Queen Margaret
happiness!
We thank you all.
Flourish
My lord protector
Between our sovereign and the French king Charles
[Reads]  'Imprimis
king Charles
Suffolk
the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret
Jerusalem
thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item
of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released
and delivered to the king her father'--
Lets the paper fall
Uncle
Pardon me
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
And dimm'd mine eyes
Uncle of Winchester
[Reads]  'Item
released and delivered over to the king her father
proper cost and charges
They please us well. Lord marquess
We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk
I' the parts of France
Be full expired. Thanks
We thank you all for the great favour done
Come
To see her coronation be perform'd.
Exeunt KING HENRY VI
Brave peers of England
What! did my brother Henry spend his youth
Did he so often lodge in open field
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits
Have you yourselves
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself
Early and late
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe
Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?
And shall these labours and these honours die?
Shall Henry's conquest
O peers of England
Fatal this marriage
Nephew
For France
Ay
But now it is impossible we should:
Suffolk
Unto the poor King Reignier
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
Now
But wherefore weeps Warwick
For grief that they are past recovery:
For
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:
And are the cities
Mort Dieu!
For Suffolk's duke
France should have torn and rent my very heart
I never read but England's kings have had
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
And our King Henry gives away his own
A proper jest
For costs and charges in transporting her!
She should have stayed in France and starved
in France
My Lord of Gloucester
It was the pleasure of my lord the King.
My Lord of Winchester
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike
Rancour will out: proud prelate
I see thy fury: if I longer stay
Lordings
Exit
So
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy
Consider
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage
Look to it
Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
What though the common people favour him
Gloucester
Clapping their hands
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
I fear me
Why should he
Cousin of Somerset
This weighty business will not brook delay:
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
Exit
Cousin of Buckingham
And greatness of his place be grief to us
His insolence is more intolerable
Than all the princes in the land beside:
If Gloucester be displaced
Or thou or I
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET
Pride went before
While these do labour for their own preferment
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
Warwick
And
Join we together
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal
And
So God help Warwick
[Aside]  And so says York
Then let's make haste away
Unto the main! O father
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win
Main chance
Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
Stands on a tickle point
Suffolk concluded on the articles
To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
'Tis thine they give away
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
And purchase friends and give to courtezans
While as the silly owner of the goods
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
Methinks the realms of England
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
Cold news for me
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right
Then
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep
Till Henry
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose
And in my standard bear the arms of York
To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
And
Exit
SCENE II. GLOUCESTER'S house.
Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS
Why droops my lord
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows
Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth
What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem
If so
Put forth thy hand
What
And
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.
O Nell
And may that thought
Against my king and nephew
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
What dream'd my lord? tell me
With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
Methought this staff
And on the pieces of the broken wand
Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset
This was my dream: what it doth bode
Tut
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
Shall lose his head for his presumption.
But list to me
Methought I sat in seat of majesty
In the cathedral church of Westminster
Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me
And on my head did set the diadem.
Nay
Presumptuous dame
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery
From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
Away from me
What
With Eleanor
Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself
Nay
Enter Messenger
My lord protector
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's
I go. Come
Yes
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger
Follow I must; I cannot go before
Were I a man
And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
And
To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
Where are you there? Sir John! nay
Enter HUME
Jesus preserve your royal majesty!
What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.
But
What say'st thou
With Margery Jourdain
And will they undertake to do me good?
This they have promised
A spirit raised from depth of under-ground
As by your grace shall be propounded him.
It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:
When from St. Alban's we do make return
Here
Exit
Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;
Marry
Seal up your lips
The business asketh silent secrecy.
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
Gold cannot come amiss
Yet have I gold flies from another coast;
I dare not say
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk
And buz these conjurations in her brain.
They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'
Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.
Hume
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
Well
Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck
Sort how it will
Exit
SCENE III. The palace.
Enter three or four Petitioners
My masters

Thy wife
yours? What's here!
Reads
'Against the Duke of Suffolk
commons of Melford.' How now
Alas
[Giving his petition]  Against my master
Horner
heir to the crown.
What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was
rightful heir to the crown?
That my master was? no
that he was
Who is there?
Enter Servant
Take this fellow in
his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear
more of your matter before the King.
Exit Servant with PETER
And as for you
Under the wings of our protector's grace
Tears the supplication
Away
Come
Exeunt
My Lord of Suffolk
Is this the government of Britain's isle
What shall King Henry be a pupil still
Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
Am I a queen in title and in style
I tell thee
Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France
In courage
But all his mind is bent to holiness
His champions are the prophets and apostles
Are brazen images of canonized saints.
I would the college of the cardinals
Would choose him pope
That were a state fit for his holiness.
Madam
Your highness came to England
In England work your grace's full content.
Beside the haughty protector
But can do more in England than the king.
And he of these that can do most of all
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
Not all these lords do vex me half so much
As that proud dame
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
Strangers in court do take her for the queen:
She bears a duke's revenues on her back
Shall I not live to be avenged on her?
Contemptuous base-born callet as she is
Was better worth than all my father's lands
Madam
So
For I am bold to counsel you in this.
Although we fancy not the cardinal
As for the Duke of York
Will make but little for his benefit.
So
Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI
For my part
Or Somerset or York
If York have ill demean'd himself in France
If Somerset be unworthy of the place
Whether your grace be worthy
Ambitious Warwick
The cardinal's not my better in the field.
All in this presence are thy betters
Warwick may live to be the best of all.
Peace
Because the king
Madam
To give his censure: these are no women's matters.
If he be old enough
To be protector of his excellence?
Madam
And
Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
Have cost a mass of public treasury.
Thy cruelty in execution
Upon offenders
They sale of offices and towns in France
Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan
Give me my fan: what
She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear
I cry you mercy
Was't I! yea
Could I come near your beauty with my nails
Sweet aunt
Against her will! good king
She'll hamper thee
Though in this place most master wear no breeches
Exit
Lord cardinal
She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs
Exit
Re-enter GLOUCESTER
Now
With walking once about the quadrangle
As for your spiteful false objections
But God in mercy so deal with my soul
But
I say
To be your regent in the realm of France.
Before we make election
To show some reason
I'll tell thee
First
Next
Last time
Till Paris was besieged
That can I witness; and a fouler fact
Did never traitor in the land commit.
Peace
Image of pride
Enter HORNER
Because here is a man accused of treason:
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
What mean'st thou
Please it your majesty
That doth accuse his master of high treason:
His words were these: that Richard
And that your majesty was a usurper.
Say
An't shall please your majesty
thought any such matter: God is my witness
falsely accused by the villain.
By these ten bones
me in the garret one night
Lord of York's armour.
Base dunghill villain and mechanical
I do beseech your royal majesty
Alas
My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct
him for his fault the other day
knees he would be even with me: I have good
witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty
accusation.
Uncle
This doom
Let Somerset be regent over the French
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place
This is the law
I humbly thank your royal majesty.
And I accept the combat willingly.
Alas
my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O
Lord
fight a blow. O Lord

Away with them to prison; and the day of combat
shall be the last of the next month. Come

Reading out of a paper
The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
But him outlive
As the Spirit speaks
'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
By water shall he die
'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
Let him shun castles;
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
Than where castles mounted stand.
Have done
Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
False fiend
Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit

Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.

My lord
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.
I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.

The treasury of everlasting joy.
Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts
Beat on a crown

With such holiness can you do it?

So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.

Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's
What means this noise?
Fellow
A miracle! a miracle!
Come to the king and tell him what miracle.
Forsooth
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
Now
Gives light in darkness
Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his  brethren
Here comes the townsmen on procession
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale
Stand by
His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.
Good fellow

Born blind

Where wert thou born?

Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.

It made me laugh to see the villain run.
Follow the knave; and take this drab away.
Alas

Exeunt Wife
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
But you have done more miracles than I;
You made in a day
Enter BUCKINGHAM
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
A sort of naughty persons
Of Lady Eleanor
Whom we have apprehended in the fact;
Raising up wicked spirits from under ground
As more at large your grace shall understand.

Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.

Flourish. Exeunt
SCENE II. London. YORK'S garden.
Enter YORK
Now
In this close walk to satisfy myself
My lord
Sweet York
Then thus:
Edward the Third
The first
The second
Was John of Gaunt
The fifth was Edmund Langley
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock
William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
Edward the Black Prince died before his father
And left behind him Richard
Till Henry Bolingbroke
Father
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
Which now they hold by force and not by right;
For Richard
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
The third son
I claimed the crown
Edmund had issue
Roger had issue
This Edmund
And
But to the rest.
His eldest sister
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son
To Edmund Langley
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
To Roger Earl of March
Of Edmund Mortimer
So
Succeed before the younger
What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt
Till Lionel's issue fails
It fails not yet
And in thy sons
Then
And in this private plot be we the first
That shall salute our rightful sovereign
With honour of his birthright to the crown.
Long live our sovereign Richard
We thank you
Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd
Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence
'Tis that they seek
Shall find their deaths
My lord
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
And
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
The greatest man in England but the king.
Exeunt
SCENE III. A hall of justice.
Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI
Stand forth
In sight of God and us
Receive the sentence of the law for sins
Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.
You four
From thence unto the place of execution:
The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes
You
Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
Eleanor
I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners
Mine eyes are full of tears
Ah
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!
I beseech your majesty
Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
Stay
Protector be; and God shall be my hope
And go in peace
Than when thou wert protector to thy King.
I see no reason why a king of years
Should be to be protected like a child.
God and King Henry govern England's realm.
Give up your staff
My staff? here
As willingly do I the same resign
As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
As others would ambitiously receive it.
Farewell
Exit
Why
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself
His lady banish'd
This staff of honour raught
Where it best fits to be
Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;
Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.

And ready are the appellant and defendant
Ay
Left I the court
O God's name
Here let them end it; and God defend the right!

Peter! what more?
Thump.
Thump! then see thou thump thy master well.

The truth and innocence of this poor fellow
Come

SCENE IV. A street.
Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
And after summer evermore succeeds
Barren winter
So cares and joys abound
Sirs
Ten
Ten is the hour that was appointed me
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets
Sweet Nell
The abject people gazing on thy face
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
But
My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.
Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet
So please your grace
No
Come you
Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
See how the giddy multitude do point
Ah
Be patient
Ah
For whilst I think I am thy married wife
And thou a prince
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
And bid me be advised how I tread.
Ah
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world
No; dark shall be my light and night my day;
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
Sometime I'll say
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
As he stood by whilst I
To every idle rascal follower.
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame
Hang over thee
For Suffolk
With her that hateth thee and hates us all
But fear not thou
Ah
I must offend before I be attainted;
And had I twenty times so many foes
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
Why
But I in danger for the breach of law.
Thy greatest help is quiet
I pray thee
These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.
Enter a Herald
I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament
And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
This is close dealing. Well
Exit Herald
My Nell
An't please your grace
To take her with him to the Isle of Man.
Must you
So am I given in charge
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
You use her well: the world may laugh again;
And I may live to do you kindness if
You do it her: and so
What
Witness my tears
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen
Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!
For none abides with me: my joy is death;
Death

I care not whither
Why
There to be used according to your state.
That's bad enough
And shall I then be used reproachfully?
Like to a duchess
According to that state you shall be used.

My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:
No

ACT III
SCENE I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.
Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man
Can you not see? or will ye not observe
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
With what a majesty he bears himself
We know the time since he was mild and affable
But meet him now
Small curs are not regarded when they grin;
But great men tremble when the lion roars;
And Humphrey is no little man in England.
First note that he is near you in descent
Me seemeth then it is no policy
And his advantage following your decease
Or be admitted to your highness' council.
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts
Now 'tis the spring
Suffer them now
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
The reverent care I bear unto my lord
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
If it be fond
Which fear if better reasons can supplant
My Lord of Suffolk
Or else conclude my words effectual.
Well hath your highness seen into this duke;
And
The duchess
Or
By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;
And in his simple show he harbours treason.
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
No
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
Did he not
And did he not
For soldiers' pay in France
By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
Tut
Which time will bring to light in smooth
Duke Humphrey.
My lords
From meaning treason to our royal person
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
The duke is virtuous
To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
Ah
Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed
Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
Take heed
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
Enter SOMERSET
All health unto my gracious sovereign!
Welcome
That all your interest in those territories
Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.
Cold news
[Aside]  Cold news for me; for I had hope of France
As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
But I will remedy this gear ere long
Enter GLOUCESTER
All happiness unto my lord the king!
Pardon
Nay
I do arrest thee of high treason here.
Well
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
The purest spring is not so free from mud
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:
Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?
'Tis thought
By means whereof his highness hath lost France.
Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay
So help me God
No; many a pound of mine own proper store
It serves you well
I say no more than truth
In your protectorship you did devise
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of
Why
protector
For I should melt at an offender's tears
Unless it were a bloody murderer
Murder indeed
Above the felon or what trespass else.
My lord
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
I do arrest you in his highness' name;
And here commit you to my lord cardinal
To keep
My lord of Gloucester
That you will clear yourself from all suspect:
My conscience tells me you are innocent.
Ah
Virtue is choked with foul ambition
And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;
Foul subornation is predominant
And equity exiled your highness' land.
I know their complot is to have my life
But mine is made the prologue to their play;
For thousands more
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
The envious load that lies upon his heart;
And dogged York
And you
My liefest liege to be mine enemy:
Ay
Myself had notice of your conventicles--
And all to make away my guiltless life.
I shall not want false witness to condemn me
The ancient proverb will be well effected:
'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'
My liege
If those that care to keep your royal person
From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
Be thus upbraided
Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
With ignominious words
False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
But I can give the loser leave to chide.
Far truer spoke than meant: I lose
Beshrew the winners
And well such losers may have leave to speak.
He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:
Lord cardinal
Sirs
Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
Ah
For
Exit
My lords
What
Ay
Ah
The map of honour
And yet
That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.
What louring star now envies thy estate
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
Thou never didst them wrong
And as the butcher takes away the calf
And binds the wretch
And as the dam runs lowing up and down
With sad unhelpful tears
Look after him and cannot do him good
His fortunes I will weep; and
Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET
Free lords
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
With sorrow snares relenting passengers
That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
Believe me
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world
That he should die is worthy policy;
But yet we want a colour for his death:
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
But
The king will labour still to save his life
And yet we have but trivial argument
So that
Ah
'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
But
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite
So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
Madam
Who being accused a crafty murderer
No; let him die
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
Be it by gins
Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
Thrice-noble Suffolk
Not resolute
For things are often spoke and seldom meant:
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue
But I would have him dead
Say you consent and censure well the deed
Here is my hand
And so say I.
And I    and now we three have spoke it
Enter a Post
Great lords
And put the Englishmen unto the sword:
Send succors
For
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
That Somerset be sent as regent thither:
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;
Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
If York
No
I rather would have lost my life betimes
Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
By staying there so long till all were lost.
Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:
Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.
Nay
No more
Thy fortune
What
And
My Lord of York
The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:
To Ireland will you lead a band of men
I will
Why
Then
I am content: provide me soldiers
A charge
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
No more of him; for I will deal with him
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
And so break off; the day is almost spent:
Lord Suffolk
My Lord of Suffolk
At Bristol I expect my soldiers;
For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.
I'll see it truly done
Exeunt all but YORK
Now
Be that thou hopest to be
Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:
Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
on thought
My brain more busy than the labouring spider
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
Well
I fear me you but warm the starved snake
your hearts.
'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:
I take it kindly; and yet be well assured
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
Until the golden circuit on my head
And
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;
And
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco
Full often
And given me notice of their villanies.
This devil here shall be my substitute;
For that John Mortimer
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind
Say he be taken
Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
Say that he thrive
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
For Humphrey being dead
Exit
SCENE II. Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state.
Enter certain Murderers
Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know
We have dispatch'd the duke
O that it were to do! What have we done?
Didst ever hear a man so penitent?
Enter SUFFOLK
Here comes my lord.
Now
Ay
Why
I will reward you for this venturous deed.
The king and all the peers are here at hand.
Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well
'Tis
Away! be gone.
Exeunt Murderers
Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI
Go
Say we intend to try his grace to-day.
If he be guilty
I'll call him presently
Exit
Lords
Than from true evidence of good esteem
He be approved in practise culpable.
God forbid any malice should prevail
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
I thank thee
Re-enter SUFFOLK
How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?
Where is our uncle? what's the matter
Dead in his bed
Marry
God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night
The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.
KING HENRY VI swoons
How fares my lord? Help
Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
Run
He doth revive again: madam
O heavenly God!
How fares my gracious lord?
Comfort
What
Came he right now to sing a raven's note
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren
Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;
Lay not thy hands on me; forbear
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
Thou baleful messenger
Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny
Sits in grim majesty
Look not upon me
Yet do not go away: come
For in the shade of death I shall find joy;
In life but double death
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
Although the duke was enemy to him
And for myself
Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life
What know I how the world may deem of me?
For it is known we were but hollow friends:
It may be judged I made the duke away;
So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded
This get I by his death: ay me
To be a queen
Ah
Be woe for me
What
I am no loathsome leper; look on me.
What! art thou
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
Why
Erect his statue and worship it
Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
Drove back again unto my native clime?
What boded this
Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest
What did I then
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore
Yet AEolus would not be a murderer
The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me
The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
And would not dash me with their ragged sides
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view
And even with this I lost fair England's view
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue
When he to madding Dido would unfold
His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!
Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
Ay me
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
Noise within. Enter WARWICK
It is reported
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.
The commons
That want their leader
And care not who they sting in his revenge.
Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny
That he is dead
But how he died God knows
Enter his chamber
That shall I do
Exit
O Thou that judgest all things
Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
If my suspect be false
Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
With twenty thousand kisses
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
And to survey his dead and earthly image
Re-enter WARWICK and others
Come hither
That is to see how deep my grave is made;
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace
As surely as my soul intends to live
With that dread King that took our state upon him
To free us from his father's wrathful curse
Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.
A dreadful oath
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
See how the blood is settled in his face.
Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost
Who
Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
To blush and beautify the cheek again.
But see
His hair uprear'd
His hands abroad display'd
And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:
Look
His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged
It cannot be but he was murder'd here;
The least of all these signs were probable.
Why
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;
And we
But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
Then you
As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest
Even so suspicious is this tragedy.
Are you the butcher
Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;
But here's a vengeful sword
That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
Say
Exeunt CARDINAL
What dares not Warwick
He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller
Madam
For every word you speak in his behalf
Is slander to your royal dignity.
Blunt-witted lord
If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much
Some stern untutor'd churl
Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art
But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
That thou thyself was born in bastardy;
And after all this fearful homage done
Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood
Away even now
Unworthy though thou art
And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK
What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
A noise within
What noise is this?
Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK
Why
Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?
Why
The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury
Set all upon me
[To the Commons
the king shall know your mind.
Dread lord
And torture him with grievous lingering death.
They say
They say
And mere instinct of love and loyalty
They say
And charge that no man should disturb your rest
In pain of your dislike or pain of death
And therefore do they cry
[Within]  An answer from the king
Lord of Salisbury!
'Tis like the commons
But you
But all the honour Salisbury hath won
Is
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.
[Within]  An answer from the king
Go
I thank them for their tender loving care;
And had I not been cited so by them
For
Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:
And therefore
But three days longer
Exit SALISBURY
O Henry
Ungentle queen
No more
Had I but said
If
On any ground that I am ruler of
Come
I have great matters to impart to thee.
Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK
Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
Heart's discontent and sour affliction
Be playfellows to keep you company!
There's two of you; the devil make a third!
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
Cease
Fie
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?
A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?
Would curses kill
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
Mine hair be fixed on end
Ay
And even now my burthen'd heart would break
Gall
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--
Enough
And these dread curses
You bade me ban
Now
O
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
O
So
'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by
I will repeal thee
And banished I am
Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
O
Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;
Once by the king
'Tis not the land I care for
A wilderness is populous enough
For where thou art
I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;
Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.
Enter VAUX
Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news
To signify unto his majesty
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him
Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
Were by his side; sometime he calls the king
And I am sent to tell his majesty
That even now he cries aloud for him.
Go tell this heavy message to the king.
Exit VAUX
Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!
But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss
Why only
Now get thee hence: the king
If thou be found by me
If I depart from thee
And in thy sight to die
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
Here could I breathe my soul into the air
Dying with mother's dug between its lips:
Where
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
To die by thee were but to die in jest;
From thee to die were torture more than death:
O
Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive
To France
For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe
I go.
And take my heart with thee.
A jewel
That ever did contain a thing of worth.
Even as a splitted bark
This way fall I to death.
This way for me.
Exeunt severally
SCENE III. A bedchamber.
Enter the KING
How fares my lord? speak
thy sovereign.
If thou be'st death
Ah
Beaufort
Bring me unto my trial when you will.
Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
Can I make men live
O
Alive again? then show me where he is:
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
He hath no eyes
Comb down his hair; look
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.
O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
O
That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.
And from his bosom purge this black despair!
See
Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.
Peace to his soul
Lord cardinal
He dies
So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
Forbear to judge
Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;
And let us all to meditation.
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. The coast of Kent.
Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a  Captain
The gaudy
Is crept into the bosom of the sea;
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
That drag the tragic melancholy night;
Who
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;
For
Master
And thou that art his mate
The other
What is my ransom
A thousand crowns
"Master's-Mate	And so much shall you give"
What
Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:
The lives of those which we have lost in fight
Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!
I'll give it
And so will I and write home for it straight.
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard
To SUFFOLK
And so should these
Be not so rash; take ransom
Look on my George; I am a gentleman:
Rate me at what thou wilt
And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.
How now! why start'st thou? what
death affright?
Thy name affrights me
A cunning man did calculate my birth
And told me that by water I should die:
Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
Thy name is Gaultier
Gaultier or Walter
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
Therefore
Stay
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
Ay
Jove sometimes went disguised
But Jove was never slain
Obscure and lowly swain
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
How often hast thou waited at my cup
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n
How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
And duly waited for my coming forth?
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
Speak
First let my words stab him
Base slave
Convey him hence and on our longboat's side
Strike off his head.
Thou darest not
Yes
Pole!
Pool! Sir Pool! lord!
Ay
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;
And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell
Unto the daughter of a worthless king
By devilish policy art thou grown great
With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France
Disdain to call us lord
Hath slain their governors
The princely Warwick
And now the house of York
By shameful murder of a guiltless king
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny
Advance our half-faced sun
The commons here in Kent are up in arms:
And
Is crept into the palace of our king.
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
O that I were a god
Upon these paltry
Small things make base men proud: this villain here
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:
It is impossible that I should die
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:
I go of message from the queen to France;
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.
Walter
Come
Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
What
My gracious lord
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough
Far be it we should honour such as these
With humble suit: no
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
Save to the God of heaven and to my king;
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
True nobility is exempt from fear:
More can I bear than you dare execute.
Hale him away
Come
Great men oft die by vile bezonians:
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders
Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.
Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk
And as for these whose ransom we have set
Therefore come you with us and let him go.
Exeunt all but the First Gentleman
Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body
There let his head and lifeless body lie
Exit
O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
His body will I bear unto the king:
If he revenge it not
So will the queen
Exit with the body
SCENE II. Blackheath.
Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND
Come
they have been up these two days.
They have the more need to sleep now
I tell thee
the commonwealth
So he had need
was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.
O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.
The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
Nay
True; and yet it is said
which is as much to say as
labouring men; and therefore should we be
magistrates.
Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a
brave mind than a hard hand.
I see them! I see them! there's Best's son
tanner of Wingham
He shall have the skin of our enemies
dog's-leather of.
And Dick the Butcher
Then is sin struck down like an ox
throat cut like a calf.
And Smith the weaver
Argo
Come
Drum. Enter CADE
We John Cade
[Aside]  Or rather
For our enemies shall fall before us
the spirit of putting down kings and princes
Silence!
My father was a Mortimer
[Aside]  He was an honest man
bricklayer.
My mother a Plantagenet
[Aside]  I knew her well; she was a midwife.
My wife descended of the Lacies
[Aside]  She was
sold many laces.
[Aside]  But now of late
furred pack
Therefore am I of an honourable house.
[Aside]  Ay
and there was he borne
father had never a house but the cage.
Valiant I am.
[Aside]  A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.
I am able to endure much.
[Aside]  No question of that; for I have seen him
whipped three market-days together.
I fear neither sword nor fire.
[Aside]  He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.
[Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of
fire
Be brave
reformation. There shall be in England seven
halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped
pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony
to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in
common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to
grass: and when I am king
God save your majesty!
I thank you
all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will
apparel them all in one livery
like brothers and worship me their lord.
The first thing we do
Nay
thing
be made parchment? that parchment

but I say

since. How now! who's there?
Enter some
The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and
cast accompt.
O monstrous!
We took him setting of boys' copies.
Here's a villain!
Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
Nay
Nay
I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man
honour; unless I find him guilty
Come hither
Emmanuel.
They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill
go hard with you.
Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? or
hast thou a mark to thyself
plain-dealing man?
Sir
that I can write my name.
He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain
and a traitor.
Away with him
ink-horn about his neck.
Exit one with the Clerk
Enter MICHAEL
Where's our general?

No.
To equal him
Kneels
Rise up Sir John Mortimer.
Rises
Now have at him!
Enter SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD
Rebellious hinds
Home to your cottages
The king is merciful
But angry
As for these silken-coated slaves
It is to you
For I am rightful heir unto the crown.
Villain
And thou thyself a shearman
And Adam was a gardener.
And what of that?
Marry
Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter
Ay
By her he had two children at one birth.
That's false.
Ay
The elder of them
And
His son am I; deny it
Nay
Sir
the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;
therefore deny it not.
And will you credit this base drudge's words
Ay
Jack Cade
[Aside]  He lies
Go to
father's sake
went to span-counter for French crowns
he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.
And furthermore
selling the dukedom of Maine.
And good reason; for thereby is England mained
fain to go with a staff
it up. Fellow kings
hath gelded the commonwealth
and more than that
therefore he is a traitor.
O gross and miserable ignorance!
Nay
enemies; go to
speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
counsellor
No
Well
Herald
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
That those which fly before the battle ends
May
And you that be the king's friends
Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY
And you that love the commons
Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.
We will not leave one lord
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;
For they are thrifty honest men
As would
They are all in order and march toward us.
But then are we in order when we are most
out of order. Come
Exeunt
SCENE III. Another part of Blackheath.
Alarums to the fight
Where's Dick
Here
They fell before thee like sheep and oxen
behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own
slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee
shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking
one.
I desire no more.
And
monument of the victory will I bear;
Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine
and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels
till I do come to London
mayor's sword borne before us.
If we mean to thrive and do good
gaols and let out the prisoners.
Fear not that
towards London.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. London. The palace.
Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication
Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind
Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
But who can cease to weep and look on this?
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:
But where's the body that I should embrace?
What answer makes your grace to the rebels'
supplication?
I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;
For God forbid so many simple souls
Should perish by the sword! And I myself
But stay
Ah
Ruled
Lord Say
Ay
How now
Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?
I fear me
No
Enter a Messenger
How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?
The rebels are in Southwark; fly
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
His army is a ragged multitude
Of hinds and peasants
Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's death
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed:
All scholars
O graceless men! they know not what they do.
My gracious lord
Ah
Lord Say
Therefore away with us to Killingworth.
So might your grace's person be in danger.
The sight of me is odious in their eyes;
And therefore in this city will I stay
And live alone as secret as I may.
Enter another Messenger
Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge:
The citizens fly and forsake their houses:
The rascal people
To spoil the city and your royal court.
Then linger not
Come
My hope is gone
Farewell
Trust nobody
The trust I have is in mine innocence
Exeunt
SCENE V. London. The Tower.
Enter SCALES upon the Tower
How now! is Jack Cade slain?
No
won the bridge
them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from
the Tower
Such aid as I can spare you shall command;
But I am troubled here with them myself;
The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.

Now is Mortimer lord of this city. And here

city's cost
claret wine this first year of our reign. And now
henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls
me other than Lord Mortimer.
Enter a Soldier
Jack Cade! Jack Cade!
Knock him down there.

If this fellow be wise

I have a suit unto your lordship.
Be it a lordship
Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.
[Aside]  Mass
thrust in the mouth with a spear
yet.
[Aside]  Nay
breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.
I have thought upon it

And henceforward all things shall be in common.

Well
art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction
regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for
giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu
dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these
presence
am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such
filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously
corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
grammar school; and whereas
had no other books but the score and the tally
hast caused printing to be used

hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
a verb
ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed
justices of peace
about matters they were not able to answer.
Moreover
they could not read
worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth
What of that?
Marry
cloak
and doublets.
And work in their shirt too; as myself
You men of Kent
What say you of Kent?
Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra
Away with him
Hear me but speak
Kent
Sweet is the country
The people liberal
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.
I sold not Maine
Justice with favour have I always done;
Prayers and tears have moved me
When have I aught exacted at your hands
Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks
This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings
For your behoof
Tut
Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
Those that I never saw and struck them dead.
O monstrous coward! what
These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.
Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.
Long sitting to determine poor men's causes
Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.
Ye shall have a hempen caudle
Why dost thou quiver
The palsy
Nay
with you: I'll see if his head will stand steadier
on a pole
Tell me wherein have I offended most?
Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.
Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
Whom have I injured
These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding
O
[Aside]  I feel remorse in myself with his words;
but I'll bridle it: he shall die
pleading so well for his life. Away with him! he
has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o'
God's name. Go
off his head presently; and then break into his
son-in-law's house
his head
It shall be done.
Ah
And therefore yet relent
Away with him! and do as I command ye.
Exeunt some with Lord SAY
The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head
on his shoulders
shall not a maid be married

Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD
Ay
Know
Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;
And here pronounce free pardon to them all
That will forsake thee and go home in peace.
What say ye
Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?
Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon
Who hateth him and honours not his father
God save the king! God save the king!
What
you
needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?
Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates
Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out
these arms till you had recovered your ancient
freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards
them break your backs with burthens
houses over your heads
daughters before your faces: for me
shift for one; and so
all!
We'll follow Cade
Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth
Will he conduct you through the heart of France
Alas
Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil
Were't not a shame
Methinks already in this civil broil
I see them lording it in London streets
Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry
Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.
To France
Spare England
Henry hath money
God on our side
A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.
Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them
to an hundred mischiefs
desolate. I see them lay their heads together to
surprise me. My sword make way for me
no staying. In despite of the devils and hell
through the very middest of you? and heavens and
honour be witness
but only my followers' base and ignominious
treasons

Was never subject long'd to be a king
As I do long and wish to be a subject.

Health and glad tidings to your majesty!

Please it your grace to be advertised
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland
Of gallowglasses and stout kerns
Is marching hitherward in proud array
The Duke of Somerset
Thus stands my state
Like to a ship that

And now is York in arms to second him.
I pray thee
Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;

For yet may England curse my wretched reign.

Fie on ambition! fie on myself
hid me in these woods and durst not peep out
all the country is laid for me; but now am I so
hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a
thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore
see if I can eat grass

was born to do me good: for many a time

must serve me to feed on.
Enter IDEN
Lord
This small inheritance my father left me
Contenteth me
I seek not to wax great by others' waning
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a

Ah
crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but
I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich
my sword like a great pin
Why
Is't not enough to break into my garden
Brave thee! ay

Nay
Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine
Set limb to limb
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
And if mine arm be heaved in the air
As for words
By my valour

the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou
sleep in thy sheath
mayst be turned to hobnails.
Here they fight. CADE falls

The king hath sent him
York
Humphrey of Buckingham
Art thou a messenger
A messenger from Henry
Or why thou
[Aside]  Scarce can I speak
O
And now
I am far better born than is the king
But I must make fair weather yet a while
Buckingham
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
The cause why I have brought this army hither
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king
That is too much presumption on thy part:
But if thy arms be to no other end
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
Upon thine honour
Upon mine honour
Then
Soldiers
Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field
And let my sovereign
I'll send them all as willing as I live:
Lands
York
We twain will go into his highness' tent.
Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants

In all submission and humility
York doth present himself unto your highness.
Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
To heave the traitor Somerset from hence
Enter IDEN

How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?

May Iden live to merit such a bounty.
And never live but true unto his liege!

Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET
See
Go
For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head
How now! is Somerset at liberty?
Then
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
False king! why hast thou broken faith with me
King did I call thee? no
That head of thine doth not become a crown;
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
And with the same to act controlling laws.
Give place: by heaven
O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.
O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee
Obey
Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these
Sirrah
Exit Attendant

Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain
Shall be the surety for their traitor father.

The sons of York
That for my surety will refuse the boys!
Enter EDWARD and RICHARD
See where they come: I'll warrant they'll
make it good.
Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD
And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
Health and all happiness to my lord the king!
Kneels
I thank thee
Nay
We are thy sovereign
For thy mistaking so
This is my king
But thou mistakest me much to think I do:
To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?
Ay
Makes him oppose himself against his king.
He is a traitor; let him to the Tower
He is arrested
His sons
Will you not
Ay
And if words will not
Why
Look in a glass
I am thy king
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY
Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.
And manacle the bear-ward in their chains
Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur
Run back and bite
Who
And such a piece of service will you do
Hence
Nay
Take heed
Why
Old Salisbury
What
O
If it be banish'd from the frosty head
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
Why art thou old
Or wherefore dost abuse it
For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me
That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
My lord
The title of this most renowned duke;
And in my conscience do repute his grace
The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
I have.
Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
It is great sin to swear unto a sin
Who can be bound by any solemn vow
To do a murderous deed
But that he was bound by a solemn oath?
A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
Call Buckingham
Call Buckingham
The first I warrant thee
You were best to go to bed and dream again
I am resolved to bear a greater storm
Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;
And that I'll write upon thy burgonet
Now
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
And tread it under foot with all contempt
And so to arms
Fie! charity
Foul stigmatic
If not in heaven

Proud northern lord

The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.
Enter CLIFFORD
Of one or both of us the time is come.
Hold
Then
As I intend
Exit
What seest thou in me
With thy brave bearing should I be in love
Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
So let it help me now against thy sword
As I in justice and true right express it.
My soul and body on the action both!
A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
They fight
La fin couronne les oeuvres.

Thus war hath given thee peace
Peace with his soul
Exit
Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;
Fear frames disorder
Where it should guard. O war
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
He that is truly dedicate to war
Hath no self-love
Hath not essentially but by circumstance
The name of valour.
Seeing his dead father
O
Knit earth and heaven together!
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast
To cease! Wast thou ordain'd
The silver livery of advised age
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine
No more will I their babes: tears virginal
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
Meet I an infant of the house of York
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
Come
As did AEneas old Anchises bear
But then AEneas bare a living load

Hath made the wizard famous in his death.

Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret
What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:
Now is it manhood
By what we can

If you be ta'en
Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape
And where this breach now in our fortunes made
May readily be stopp'd.
Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD

Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.

Now
By the mass
God knows how long it is I have to live;
And it hath pleased him that three times to-day
You have defended me from imminent death.
Well
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled
I know our safety is to follow them;
For
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.
What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?
After them! nay
Now
Saint Alban's battle won by famous York
Shall be eternized in all age to come.
Sound drums and trumpets
And more such days as these to us befall!
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. London. The Parliament-house.
Alarum. Enter YORK
I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
While we pursued the horsemen of the north
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
Lord Stafford's father
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
That this is true
And
Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
Throwing down SOMERSET's head
Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
But is your grace dead
Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
And so do I. Victorious Prince of York
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps
This is the palace of the fearful king
For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
Assist me
For hither we have broken in by force.
We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
Thanks
And
They go up
And when the king comes
The queen this day here holds her parliament
By words or blows here let us win our right.
Arm'd as we are
The bloody parliament shall this be call'd
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
Then leave me not
I mean to take possession of my right.
Neither the king
I'll plant Plantagenet
Resolve thee
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI
My lords
Earl of Northumberland
And thine
On him
If I be not
The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
What
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
Be patient
Patience is for poltroons
He durst not sit there
My gracious lord
Let us assail the family of York.
Well hast thou spoken
Ah
But when the duke is slain
Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart
Cousin of Exeter
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
Thou factious Duke of York
I am thy sovereign.
I am thine.
For shame
'Twas my inheritance
Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
Exeter
In following this usurping Henry.
Whom should he follow but his natural king?
TRUE
And shall I stand
It must and shall be so: content thyself.
Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field
And slew your fathers
March'd through the city to the palace gates.
Yes
And
Plantagenet
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
Urge it no more; lest that
As shall revenge his death before I stir.
Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not
What title hast thou
Thy father was
Thy grandfather
I am the son of Henry the Fifth
And seized upon their towns and provinces.
Talk not of France
The lord protector lost it
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
You are old enough now
Father
Sweet father
Good brother
Sound drums and trumpets
Sons
Peace
Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him
And be you silent and attentive too
Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Ay
My title's good
Prove it
Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
'Twas by rebellion against his king.
[Aside]  I know not what to say; my title's weak.--
Tell me
What then?
An if he may
For Richard
He rose against him
Suppose
No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
Art thou against us
His is the right
Why whisper you
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
[Aside]  All will revolt from me
Plantagenet
Deposed he shall be
Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power
King Henry
May that ground gape and swallow me alive
O Clifford
Henry of Lancaster
What mutter you
Do right unto this princely Duke of York
He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves
My Lord of Warwick
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
I am content: Richard Plantagenet
What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
What good is this to England and himself!
Base
How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
I cannot stay to hear these articles.
Nor I.
Come
Farewell
Be thou a prey unto the house of York
In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND
Turn this way
They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
Ah
Why should you sigh
Not for myself
But be it as it may: I here entail
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
Conditionally
To cease this civil war
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
This oath I willingly take and will perform.
Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
Sennet. Here they come down
Farewell
And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
And I to Norfolk with my followers.
And I unto the sea from whence I came.
Exeunt YORK
And I
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
Here comes the queen
I'll steal away.
Exeter
Nay
Be patient
Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah
And never seen thee
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I
And disinherited thine only son.
Father
If you be king
Pardon me
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
Enforced thee! art thou king
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah
Thou hast undone thyself
And given unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown
And creep into it far before thy time?
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The duke is made protector of the realm;
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Had I been there
Before I would have granted to that act.
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
And seeing thou dost
Both from thy table
Whereby my son is disinherited.
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine
And spread they shall be
And utter ruin of the house of York.
Thus do I leave thee. Come
Our army is ready; come
Stay
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
Gentle son Edward
Ay
When I return with victory from the field
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
Come
Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD
Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
Come
And I
Exeunt
SCENE II. Sandal Castle.
Enter RICHARD
Brother
No
But I have reasons strong and forcible.
Enter YORK
Why
What is your quarrel? how began it first?
No quarrel
About what?
About that which concerns your grace and us;
The crown of England
Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
Your right depends not on his life or death.
Now you are heir
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe
I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
I shall be
I'll prove the contrary
Thou canst not
An oath is of no moment
Before a true and lawful magistrate
Henry had none
Then
Therefore
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
Richard
Brother
Thou
You Edward
In them I trust; for they are soldiers
While you are thus employ'd
Enter a Messenger
But
The queen with all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
And therefore fortify your hold
Ay
Edward and Richard
My brother Montague shall post to London:
Let noble Warwick
Brother
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
Exit
Enter JOHN MORTIMER and HUGH MORTIMER
Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer
The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
What
Ay
A woman's general; what should we fear?
A march afar off
I hear their drums: let's set our men in order
Five men to twenty! though the odds be great
Many a battle have I won in France
Why should I not now have the like success?
Alarum. Exeunt
SCENE III. Field of battle betwixt Sandal Castle and Wakefield.

As for the brat of this accursed duke
And I
Soldiers
Ah
Exit
How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
That trembles under his devouring paws;
And so he walks
Ah
Sweet Clifford
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
Be thou revenged on men
In vain thou speak'st
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
Then let my father's blood open it again:
He is a man
Had thy brethren here
Were not revenge sufficient for me;
No
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains
The sight of any of the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul;
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive
Therefore--
Lifting his hand
O
To thee I pray; sweet Clifford
Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
Thy father hath.
But 'twas ere I was born.
Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me
Ah
And when I give occasion of offence
No cause!
Thy father slew my father; therefore
Stabs him
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
Dies
Plantagenet! I come
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
Shall rust upon my weapon
Exit
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
Alarum. Enter YORK
The army of the queen hath got the field:
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fly
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons
But this I know
Like men born to renown by life or death.
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
And thrice cried 'Courage
And full as oft came Edward to my side
In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
And when the hardiest warriors did retire
And cried 'A crown
A sceptre
With this
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
A short alarum within
Ah
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
And were I strong
The sands are number'd that make up my life;
Here must I stay
Enter QUEEN MARGARET
Come
I am your butt
Yield to our mercy
Ay
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car
My ashes
A bird that will revenge upon you all:
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven
Why come you not? what! multitudes
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
So desperate thieves
O Clifford
And
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
I will not bandy with thee word for word
Hold
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou
Hold
To prick thy finger
What valour were it
It is war's prize to take all vantages;
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
They lay hands on YORK
Ay
So doth the cony struggle in the net.
So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
So true men yield
What would your grace have done unto him now?
Brave warriors
What! was it you that would be England's king?
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or
Look
That valiant Clifford
And if thine eyes can water for his death
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly
I prithee
What
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
Why art thou patient
And I
Stamp
Thou wouldst be fee'd
York cannot speak
A crown for York! and
Hold you his hands
Putting a paper crown on his head
Ay
Ay
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crown'd so soon
As I bethink me
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory
O
Off with the crown
And
That is my office
Nay
She-wolf of France
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph
But that thy face is
To tell thee whence thou camest
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
It needs not
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abominable:
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child
Women are soft
Thou stern
Bids't thou me rage? why
Wouldst have me weep? why
For raging wind blows up incessant showers
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
And every drop cries vengeance for his death
Frenchwoman.
Beshrew me
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
That face of his the hungry cannibals
Would not have touch'd
But you are more inhuman
See
This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy
Keep thou the napkin
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears
There
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
Hard-hearted Clifford
My soul to heaven
Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
What
Think but upon the wrong he did us all
Here's for my oath
Stabbing him
And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.
Stabbing him
Open Thy gate of mercy
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.
Dies
Off with his head
So York may overlook the town of York.
Flourish. Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.
A march. Enter EDWARD
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he been ta'en
Had he been slain
Or had he 'scaped
The happy tidings of his good escape.
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
I cannot joy
Where our right valiant father is become.
I saw him in the battle range about;
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
Or as a bear
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike father:
Methinks
See how the morning opes her golden gates
How well resembles it the prime of youth
Dazzle mine eyes
Three glorious suns
Not separated with the racking clouds
See
Now are they but one lamp
In this the heaven figures some event.
'Tis wondrous strange
I think it cites us
And over-shine the earth as this the world.
Whate'er it bodes
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
Nay
Enter a Messenger
But what art thou
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
Ah
When as the noble Duke of York was slain
O
Say how he died
Environed he was with many foes
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
And many strokes
By many hands your father was subdued;
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland
And after many scorns
They set the same; and there it doth remain
Sweet Duke of York
O Clifford
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
Ah
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
For never henceforth shall I joy again
I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Richard
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
Nay
For chair and dukedom
Either that is thine
March. Enter WARWICK
How now
Great Lord of Warwick
Our baleful news
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
O valiant lord
O Warwick
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
And now
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought
I
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
Short tale to make
Our battles join'd
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king
Or whether 'twas report of her success;
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour
Our soldiers'
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
Lord George your brother
For in the marches here we heard you were
Where is the Duke of Norfolk
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
And for your brother
From your kind aunt
'Twas odds
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit
Nor now my scandal
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head
As he is famed for mildness
I know it well
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
But in this troublous time what's to be done?
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
If for the last
Why
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me
He swore consent to your succession
And now to London all the crew are gone
May make against the house of Lancaster.
Their power
Now
But never once again turn back and fly.
Ay
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day
Lord Warwick
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
Must Edward fall
No longer Earl of March
The next degree is England's royal throne;
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
In every borough as we pass along;
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
King Edward
Then
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
Enter a Messenger
How now! what news?
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
And craves your company for speedy counsel.
Why then it sorts
Exeunt
SCENE II. Before York.
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI
Welcome
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
Doth not the object cheer your heart
Ay
To see this sight
Withhold revenge
My gracious liege
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown
He
Thou
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight
For shame
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah
And let his manly face
Successful fortune
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator
But
That things ill-got had ever bad success?
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
And would my father had left me no more!
For all the rest is held at such a rate
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
Ah
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
My lord
You promised knighthood to our forward son:
Unsheathe your sword
Edward
Edward Plantagenet
And learn this lesson
My gracious father
Why
Enter a Messenger
Royal commanders
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick
And in the towns
Darraign your battle
I would your highness would depart the field:
The queen hath best success when you are absent.
Ay
Why
Be it with resolution then to fight.
My royal father
And hearten those that fight in your defence:
Unsheathe your sword
March. Enter EDWARD
Now
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
Go
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
I am his king
I was adopted heir by his consent:
Since when
And reason too:
Who should succeed the father but the son?
Are you there
Ay
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland
Ay
For God's sake
What say'st thou
Why
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last
Then 'twas my turn to fly
You said so much before
'Twas not your valour
No
Northumberland
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford
I slew thy father
Ay
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
Have done with words
Defy them then
I prithee
I am a king
My liege
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
Then
By him that made us all
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
Say
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
If thou deny
For York in justice puts his armour on.
If that be right which Warwick says is right
Whoever got thee
For
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt
As if a channel should be call'd the sea
Shamest thou not
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
By that false woman
His father revell'd in the heart of France
And had he match'd according to his state
But when he took a beggar to his bed
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Hadst thou been meek
And we
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves
And
Not willing any longer conference
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory
Stay
No
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.
Exeunt
SCENE III. A field of battle between Towton and Saxton
Yorkshire.
Alarum. Excursions. Enter WARWICK
Forspent with toil
For strokes received
Enter EDWARD
Smile
For this world frowns
How now
Enter GEORGE
Our hap is loss
Our ranks are broke
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?
Bootless is flight
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.
Enter RICHARD
Ah
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
And in the very pangs of death he cried
So
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
I'll kill my horse
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here
And look upon
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
Here on my knee I vow to God above
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.
O Warwick
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And
That to my foes this body must be prey
Now
Brother
I
That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
Away
Yet let us all together to our troops
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
And
As victors wear at the Olympian games:
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;
For yet is hope of life and victory.
Forslow no longer
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
Excursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD
Now
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York
Now
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself;
And so
They fight. WARWICK comes; CLIFFORD flies
Nay Warwick
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
Exeunt
SCENE V. Another part of the field.
Alarum. Enter KING HENRY VI alone
This battle fares like to the morning's war
Now sways it this way
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
Now sways it that way
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
Sometime the flood prevails
Now one the better
Both tugging to be victors
So is the equal of this fell war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God will
For Margaret my queen
They prosper best of all when I am thence.
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
For what is in this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life
To sit upon a hill
How many hours bring about the day;
How many days will finish up the year;
How many years a mortal man may live.
When this is known
So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many hours must I take my rest;
So many hours must I contemplate;
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many days my ewes have been with young;
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
So minutes
Ah
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
O
And to conclude
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade
Alarum. Enter a Son that has killed his father
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
This man
And I
To some man else
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face
O heavy times
From London by the king was I press'd forth;
My father
And I
Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
Pardon me
And pardon
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens
Weep
And let our hearts and eyes
Enter a Father that has killed his son
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me
For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
Ah
Ah
O
What stratagems
O boy
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
O pity
The red rose and the white are on his face
The one his purple blood right well resembles;
The other his pale cheeks
Wither one rose
If you contend
How will my mother for a father's death
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
How will my wife for slaughter of my son
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
How will the country for these woful chances
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
Was ever son so rued a father's death?
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
I'll bear thee hence
Exit with the body
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
My heart
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
And so obsequious will thy father be
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will
Exit with the body
Sad-hearted men
Alarums: excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET
Fly
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
Mount you
Edward and Richard
Having the fearful flying hare in sight
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
Nay
Or else come after: I'll away before.
Nay
Not that I fear to stay
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Another part of the field.
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD
Here burns my candle out; ay
O Lancaster
More than my body's parting with my soul!
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
And
Impairing Henry
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
O Phoebus
That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds
And
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
Bootless are plaints
No way to fly
The foe is merciless
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
The air hath got into my deadly wounds
Come
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms
He faints
Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD
Now breathe we
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen
But think you
No
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
And wheresoe'er he is
CLIFFORD groans
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
A deadly groan
See who it is: and
Revoke that doom of mercy
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
From off the gates of York fetch down the head
Instead whereof let this supply the room:
Measure for measure must be answered.
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound
I think his understanding is bereft.
Speak
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life
O
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit
Which in the time of death he gave our father.
If so thou think'st
Clifford
Clifford
Clifford
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
Thou didst love York
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.
Where's Captain Margaret
They mock thee
What
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
I know by that he's dead; and
issuing blood
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
Ay
And now to London with triumphant march
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
And
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
First will I see the coronation;
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea
Even as thou wilt
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
Richard
Let me be Duke of Clarence
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.

ACT III
SCENE I. A forest in the north of England.
Enter two Keepers
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
For through this laund anon the deer will come;
And in this covert will we make our stand
I'll stay above the hill
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
Will scare the herd
Here stand we both
And
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
Enter KING HENRY VI
From Scotland am I stol'n
No
Thy place is fill'd
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now
For how can I help them
Ay
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.
Let me embrace thee
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
And
Is thither gone
To wife for Edward: if this news be true
For Warwick is a subtle orator
By this account then Margaret may win him;
For she's a woman to be pitied much:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
And Nero will be tainted with remorse
Ay
She
She weeps
He smiles
That she
Whiles Warwick tells his title
O Margaret
Say
More than I seem
A man at least
And men may talk of kings
Ay
Why
But
My crown is in my heart
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
Well
To go along with us; for as we think
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy.
But did you never swear
No
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
Here in this country
I was anointed king at nine months old;
My father and my grandfather were kings
And tell me
No;
For we were subjects but while you were king.
Why
Ah
Look
Such is the lightness of you common men.
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
Go where you will
And be you kings
We are true subjects to the king
So would you be again to Henry
We charge you
In God's name
And what God will
And what he will
Exeunt
SCENE II. London. The palace.
Enter KING EDWARD IV
Brother of Gloucester
This lady's husband
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot well deny
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were dishonour to deny it her.
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea
I see the lady hath a thing to grant
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true
he keeps the wind!
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!
Widow
And come some other time to know our mind.
Right gracious lord
May it please your highness to resolve me now;
And what your pleasure is
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay
you all your lands
Fight closer
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not
chance to fall.
[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll
take vantages.
How many children hast thou
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a
child of her.
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay
give her two.
Three
[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four
be ruled by him.
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
Be pitiful
Lords
[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay
you will have leave
GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire
Now tell me
Ay
And would you not do much to do them good?
To do them good
Then get your husband's lands
Therefore I came unto your majesty.
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
What service wilt thou do me
What you command
But you will take exceptions to my boon.
No
Ay
Why
[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard; and much rain
wears the marble.
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay
her wax must melt.
Why stops my lord
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
That's soon perform'd
Why
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made; she seals it
with a curtsy.
But stay thee
The fruits of love I mean
Ay
What love
My love till death
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
No
Why
But now you partly may perceive my mind.
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your highness aims at
To tell thee plain
To tell you plain
Why
Why
For by that loss I will not purchase them.
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
But
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
Ay
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
Then
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not
knits her brows.
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in
Christendom.
[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;
Her words do show her wit incomparable;
All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
One way or other
And she shall be my love
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
'Tis better said than done
I am a subject fit to jest withal
Sweet widow
I speak no more than what my soul intends;
And that is
And that is more than I will yield unto:
I know I am too mean to be your queen
You cavil
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
Thou art a widow
And
To be the father unto many sons.
Answer no more
[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done
his shrift.
[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver
Brothers
The widow likes it not
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
To whom
Why
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
By so much is the wonder in extremes.
Well
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
Enter a Nobleman
My gracious lord
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
And go we
Widow
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Ay
Would he were wasted
And yet
The lustful Edward's title buried--
Is Clarence
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Why
Like one that stands upon a promontory
So do I wish the crown
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I say
My eye's too quick
Well
What other pleasure can the world afford?
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap
O miserable thought! and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Why
And
To make an envious mountain on my back
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part
That carries no impression like the dam.
And am I then a man to be beloved?
O monstrous fault
Then
As are of better person than myself
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
And yet I know not how to get the crown
And I
Not knowing how to find the open air
Torment myself to catch the English crown:
And from that torment I will free myself
Why
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor
I can add colours to the chameleon
Can I do this

SCENE III. France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.
Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI
Fair Queen of England
And birth
No
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Where kings command. I was
But now mischance hath trod my title down
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune
Why
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue
Whate'er it be
Seats her by him
Yield not thy neck
To fortune's yoke
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Be plain
It shall be eased
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Now
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
This is the cause that I
And if thou fail us
Scotland hath will to help
Our people and our peers are both misled
Renowned queen
The more we stay
The more I stay
O
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
Enter WARWICK
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
Our Earl of Warwick
Welcome
He descends. She ariseth
Ay
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
From worthy Edward
And then to crave a league of amity;
And lastly
With a nuptial knot
That virtuous Lady Bona
[Aside]  If that go forward
[To BONA]  And
To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
Where fame
King Lewis and Lady Bona
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love
For how can tyrants safely govern home
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
Look
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile
Injurious Margaret!
And why not queen?
Because thy father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt
And
And
From these our Henry lineally descends.
Oxford
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
But for the rest
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
Why
Can Oxford
For shame! leave Henry
Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother
No
And I the house of York.
Queen Margaret
They stand aloof
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
Now Warwick
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
But is he gracious in the people's eye?
The more that Henry was unfortunate.
Then further
Unto our sister Bona.
Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant
Now
Your grant
To WARWICK
Yet I confess that often ere this day
Then
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching the jointure that your king must make
Draw near
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
To Edward
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
By this alliance to make void my suit:
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
And still is friend to him and Margaret:
But if your title to the crown be weak
From giving aid which late I promised.
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield.
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease
And as for you yourself
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
Peace
I will not hence
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
Post blows a horn within
Warwick
Enter a Post
[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador
To KING LEWIS XI
These from our king unto your majesty:
To QUEEN MARGARET
And
They all read their letters
I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
Smiles at her news
Nay
I hope all's for the best.
Warwick
Mine
Mine
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
And now
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
I told your majesty as much before:
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
King Lewis
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him
My noble queen
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona
Warwick
And I forgive and quite forget old faults
So much his friend
With some few bands of chosen soldiers
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
And as for Clarence
Dear brother
But by thy help to this distressed queen?
Renowned prince
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
And mine
And mine with hers
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
You shall have aid.
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
Then
To revel it with him and his new bride:
Thou seest what's past
Tell him
Tell him
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
There's thy reward: be gone.
Exit Post
But
And
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
Yet
This shall assure my constant loyalty
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
Yes
Son Edward
And
Yes
And here
He gives his hand to WARWICK
Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance
Exeunt all but WARWICK
I came from Edward as ambassador
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
Had he none else to make a stale but me?
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
I was the chief that raised him to the crown
Not that I pity Henry's misery
Exit
ACT IV
SCENE I. London. The palace.
Enter GLOUCESTER
Now tell me
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
Alas
How could he stay till Warwick made return?
My lords
And his well-chosen bride.
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV
Now
As well as Lewis of France
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
Suppose they take offence without a cause
And shall have your will
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
Yea
Not I:
No
Whom God hath join'd together; ay
To sunder them that yoke so well together.
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside
Should not become my wife and England's queen.
And you too
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
And Warwick
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
By such invention as I can devise?
Yet
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
Why
England is safe
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
'Tis better using France than trusting France:
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
Which He hath given for fence impregnable
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
Ay
And for this once my will shall stand for law.
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well
Unto the brother of your loving bride;
She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son
Alas
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
In choosing for yourself
To play the broker in mine own behalf;
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
Leave me
My lords
To raise my state to title of a queen
That I was not ignoble of descent;
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
But as this title honours me and mine
My love
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee
Nay
Which if they do
[Aside]  I hear
Enter a Post
Now
From France?
My sovereign liege
Go to
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
At my depart
'Go tell false Edward
To revel it with him and his new bride.'
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
These were her words
'Tell him
I blame not her
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
For I have heard that she was there in place.
'Tell him
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
But what said Warwick to these injuries?
He
Than all the rest
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
Well I will arm me
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
But say
Ay
friendship
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
Now
That
I may not prove inferior to yourself.
You that love me and Warwick
Exit CLARENCE
[Aside]  Not I:
My thoughts aim at a further matter; I
Stay not for the love of Edward
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
And haste is needful in this desperate case.
Pembroke and Stafford
Go levy men
They are already
Myself in person will straight follow you.
Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD
But
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
If it be so
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
But if you mind to hold your true obedience
So God help Montague as he proves true!
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
Now
Ay
Why
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour
Exeunt
SCENE II. A plain in Warwickshire.
Enter WARWICK and OXFORD
Trust me
The common people by numbers swarm to us.
Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
Speak suddenly
Fear not that
Then
And welcome
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
Else might I think that Clarence
But welcome
And now what rests but
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents
And seize himself; I say not
You that will follow me to this attempt
They all cry
Why
For Warwick and his friends
Exeunt
SCENE III. Edward's camp
Enter three Watchmen
Come on
The king by this is set him down to sleep.
What
Why
Never to lie and take his natural rest
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
To-morrow then belike shall be the day
But say
That with the king here resteth in his tent?
'Tis the Lord Hastings
O
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him
'Tis the more honour
Ay
I like it better than a dangerous honour.
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
Ay
Enter WARWICK
This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
Courage
But follow me
Who goes there?
Stay
WARWICK and the rest cry all
The drum playing and trumpet sounding
What are they that fly there?
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.
The duke! Why
Ay
When you disgraced me in my embassade
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom
Yea
Nay
Yet
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state
Then
Takes off his crown
But Henry now shall wear the English crown
My Lord of Somerset
Unto my brother
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
Now
They lead him out forcibly
What fates impose
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
Exit
What now remains
But march to London with our soldiers?
Ay
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him seated in the regal throne.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. London. The palace.
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS
Madam
Why brother Rivers
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
No
Then is my sovereign slain?
Ay
Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
And
These news I must confess are full of grief;
Yet
Warwick may lose
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
And I the rather wean me from despair
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
This is it that makes me bridle passion
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
Ay
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs
King Edward's fruit
But
I am inform'd that he comes towards London
Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down
For trust not him that hath once broken faith
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
Come
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.
Exeunt
SCENE V. A park near Middleham Castle In Yorkshire.
Enter GLOUCESTER
Now
Thus stands the case: you know our king
He hath good usage and great liberty
I have advertised him by secret means
That if about this hour he make his way
Under the colour of his usual game
To set him free from his captivity.
Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him
This way
Nay
Now
Brother
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
But whither shall we then?
To Lynn
Well guess'd
Stanley
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
Huntsman
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
Come then
Bishop
And pray that I may repossess the crown.
Exeunt
SCENE VI. London. The Tower.
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI
Master lieutenant
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
But if an humble prayer may prevail
For what
Nay
Ay
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of household harmony
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
But
He was the author
Therefore
By living low
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
And now may seem as wise as virtuous
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace
No
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
And I choose Clarence only for protector.
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
Now join your hands
I make you both protectors of this land
And in devotion spend my latter days
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
That he consents
For on thy fortune I repose myself.
Why
We'll yoke together
To Henry's body
I mean
And
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor
What else? and that succession be determined.
Ay
But
Be sent for
For
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
It shall be done
My Lord of Somerset
My liege
Come hither
Lays his hand on his head
If secret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
His looks are full of peaceful majesty
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
Make much of him
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
Enter a Post
What news
That Edward is escaped from your brother
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
And the Lord Hastings
In secret ambush on the forest side
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
For hunting was his daily exercise.
My brother was too careless of his charge.
But let us hence
A salve for any sore that may betide.
Exeunt all but SOMERSET
My lord
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help
As Henry's late presaging prophecy
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond
What may befall him
Therefore
Ay
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
Come
Exeunt
SCENE VII. Before York.
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV
Now
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
And brought desired help from Burgundy:
What then remains
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York
The gates made fast! Brother
For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
Tush
By fair or foul means we must enter in
My liege
Enter
My lords
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
But
TRUE
Why
[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose
Why
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
Ay
They descend
A wise stout captain
The good old man would fain that all were well
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen
So
But in the night or in the time of war.
What! fear not
Takes his keys
For Edward will defend the town and thee
March. Enter MONTGOMERY
Brother
Welcome
To help King Edward in his time of storm
Thanks
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
Then fare you well
I came to serve a king and not a duke.
Drummer
The drum begins to march
Nay
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
What talk you of debating? in few words
To keep them back that come to succor you:
Why shall we fight
Why
When we grow stronger
Till then
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
Brother
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right
Ay
And now will I be Edward's champion.
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
Come
Flourish
Edward the Fourth
England and France
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right
Throws down his gauntlet
Long live Edward the Fourth!
Thanks
If fortune serve me
Now
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this horizon
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
Ah
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
Yet
Come on
Exeunt
SCENE VIII. London. The palace.
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI
What counsel
And many giddy people flock to him.
Let's levy men
A little fire is quickly trodden out;
Which
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends
Those will I muster up: and thou
Thou
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
And thou
My sovereign
Fair lords
Farewell
Farewell
In sign of truth
Well-minded Clarence
Comfort
And thus I seal my truth
Sweet Oxford
Farewell
Exeunt all but KING HENRY VI and EXETER
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
Cousin of Exeter
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine.
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
I have not been desirous of their wealth
Nor forward of revenge
Then why should they love Edward more than me?
No
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb
Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!'
Hark
Enter KING EDWARD IV
Seize on the shame-faced Henry
And once again proclaim us King of England.
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry
Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.
Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI
And
Where peremptory Warwick now remains:
The sun shines hot; and
Away betimes
Brave warriors
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. Coventry.
Enter WARWICK
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
How far hence is thy lord
By this at Dunsmore
How far off is our brother Montague?
Where is the post that came from Montague?
By this at Daintry
Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE
Say
And
At Southam I did leave him with his forces
Drum heard
Then Clarence is at hand
It is not his
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
Who should that be? belike
They are at hand
March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV
Go
See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
Where slept our scouts
Now
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
Nay
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
I thought
Or did he make the jest against his will?
Is not a dukedom
Ay
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
Why then 'tis mine
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
And weakling
And Henry is my king
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
And
What is the body when the head is off?
Alas
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
Come
Nay
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow
Sail how thou canst
Shall
Enter OXFORD
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!
Oxford
He and his forces enter the city
The gates are open
So other foes may set upon our backs.
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle:
If not
O
Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours
Montague
He and his forces enter the city
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
The harder match'd
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.
Enter SOMERSET
Somerset
He and his forces enter the city
Two of thy name
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
Enter CLARENCE
And lo
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
More than the nature of a brother's love!
Come
Father of Warwick
Taking his red rose out of his hat
Look here
I will not ruinate my father's house
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
To keep that oath were more impiety
Than Jephthah's
I am so sorry for my trespass made
That
As I will meet thee
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
And so
Pardon me
And
Now welcome more
Welcome
O passing traitor
What
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
Alas
I will away towards Barnet presently
Yes
Lords
Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company follow
SCENE II. A field of battle near Barnet.
Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD IV
So
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
Now
Exit
Ah
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows
That I must yield my body to the earth
And
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
These eyes
The wrinkles in my brows
For who lived king
And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
Lo
My parks
Even now forsake me
Is nothing left me but my body's length.
Why
And
Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET
Ah
We might recover all our loss again;
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
Even now we heard the news: ah
Why
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
Thou lovest me not; for
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
Come quickly
Ah
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick
And more he would have said
I well might hear
Sweet rest his soul! Fly
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.
Dies
Away
Here they bear away his body. Exeunt
SCENE III. Another part of the field.
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph; with GLOUCESTER
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
But
I mean
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
And
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it came:
The very beams will dry those vapours up
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong
If she have time to breathe be well assured
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.
We are advertised by our loving friends
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
We
And
In every county as we go along.
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Plains near Tewksbury.
March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET
Great lords
What though the mast be now blown overboard
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much
Ah
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
And Montague our topmost; what of him?
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
Why
And Somerset another goodly mast?
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
And
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
We will not from the helm to sit and weep
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
All these the enemies to our poor bark.
Say you can swim; alas
Tread on the sand; why
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off
This speak I
More than with ruthless waves
Why
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should
And make him
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have leave to go away betimes
And make him of like spirit to himself.
If any such be here--as God forbid!--
Let him depart before we need his help.
Women and children of so high a courage
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
To bear his image and renew his glories!
And he that will not fight for such a hope.
Go home to bed
Thanks
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
Enter a Messenger
Prepare you
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.
I thought no less: it is his policy
To haste thus fast
But he's deceived; we are in readiness.
This cheers my heart
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV
Brave followers
I need not add more fuel to your fire
Give signal to the fight
Lords
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak
Therefore
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
You fight in justice: then
Alarum. Retreat. Excursions. Exeunt

For bearing arms
Speak like a subject
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
Resign thy chair

That you might still have worn the petticoat
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
His currish riddles sort not with this place.
By heaven
Ay
For God's sake
Nay

Untutor'd lad
I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
Lascivious Edward
I am your better
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
Take that

O Ned
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all
He was a man; this
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
What's worse than murderer
No
And I will speak
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
You have no children
But if you ever chance to have a child
As
Away with her; go
Nay
What
By heaven
Good Clarence
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
Ay
'Twas sin before

Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
Away
So come to you and yours

Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
With pay and thanks
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:

So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
The bird that hath been limed in a bush
And I
Where my poor young was limed
Why
An yet

Thy father
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother Edward
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
Ah
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
Than can my ears that tragic history.
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
Think'st thou I am an executioner?
A persecutor
If murdering innocents be executing
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume
And thus I prophesy
Men for their sons
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
The owl shriek'd at thy birth
The night-crow cried
Dogs howl'd
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top

Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
And

Ay
God forgive my sins

See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
O
From those that wish the downfall of our house!
If any spark of life be yet remaining
Stabs him again
I
Indeed
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward:
Had I not reason
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
'O
And so I was; which plainly signified
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
Then
I have no brother
And this word 'love
And not in me: I am myself alone.
Clarence
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
For I will buz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life
King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
Clarence
I'll throw thy body in another room
And triumph
Exit
SCENE VII. London. The palace.
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV
Once more we sit in England's royal throne
What valiant foemen
Three Dukes of Somerset
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
With them
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither
Young Ned
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
[Aside]  I'll blast his harvest
For yet I am not look'd on in the world.
This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;
And heave it shall some weight
Work thou the way
Clarence and Gloucester
And kiss your princely nephew
The duty that I owe unto your majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.
Thanks
And
Aside
And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.
Now am I seated as my soul delights
What will your grace have done with Margaret?

With stately triumphs
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!

You shall find of the king a husband
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
than lack it where there is such abundance.
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
He hath abandoned his physicians
practises he hath persecuted time with hope
finds no other advantage in the process but only the
losing of hope by time.
This young gentlewoman had a father
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
far
should have play for lack of work. Would
king's sake
the death of the king's disease.
How called you the man you speak of
He was famous
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
He was excellent indeed
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
was skilful enough to have lived still
could be set up against mortality.
What is it
A fistula
I heard not of it before.
I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
His sole child
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
her education promises; her dispositions she
inherits
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
traitors too; in her they are the better for their
simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
Your commendations
'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
livelihood from her cheek. No more of this
go to
a sorrow than have it.
I do affect a sorrow indeed
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead
If the living be enemy to the grief
makes it soon mortal.
Madam
How understand we that?
Be thou blest
In manners
Contend for empire in thee
Share with thy birthright! Love all
Rather in power than use
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord
He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love.
Heaven bless him! Farewell
Exit
[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in
your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
to my mother
Farewell
your father.
Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
O
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
I have forgot him: my imagination
Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
I am undone: there is no living
That I should love a bright particular star
And think to wed it
In his bright radiance and collateral light
Must I be comforted
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
The hind that would be mated by the lion
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty
His arched brows
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
But now he's gone
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
Enter PAROLLES
Aside
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
And yet I know him a notorious liar
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him
Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
Save you
And you
No.
And no.
Are you meditating on virginity?
Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
may we barricado it against him?
Keep him out.
But he assails; and our virginity
warlike resistance.
There is none: man
undermine you and blow you up.
Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
blowers up! Is there no military policy
virgins might blow up men?
Virginity being blown down
blown up: marry
the breach yourselves made
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
increase and there was never virgin got till
virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
may be ten times found; by being ever kept
ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
I will stand for 't a little
There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
virginity murders itself and should be buried in
highways out of all sanctified limit
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites
paring
Besides
self-love
canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
itself ten
principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
How might one do
Let me see: marry
likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
lying; the longer kept
while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
Virginity
of fashion: richly suited
like the brooch and the tooth-pick
now. Your date is better in your pie and your
porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity
withered pears
marry
Not my virginity yet [         ]
There shall your master have a thousand loves
His humble ambition
Of pretty
I know not what he shall. God send him well!

Why under Mars?
The wars have so kept you under that you must needs

When he was predominant.
When he was retrograde
Why think you so?
You go so much backward when you fight.
That's for advantage.
So is running away

I am so full of businesses

Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie

Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
What power is it which mounts my love so high
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things.

That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose

Have fought with equal fortune and continue
A braving war.
So 'tis reported
Nay

For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
Prejudicates the business and would seem
To have us make denial.
His love and wisdom

It is the Count Rousillon
Youth
Frank nature
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.
I would I had that corporal soundness now
First tried our soldiership! He did look far
Into the service of the time and was
Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
But on us both did haggish age steal on
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
To talk of your good father. In his youth
He had the wit which I can well observe
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
So like a courtier
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were
Exception bid him speak
His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
He used as creatures of another place
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks
Might be a copy to these younger times;
Which
But goers backward.
His good remembrance
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech.
Would I were with him! He would always say--
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
He scatter'd not in ears
This his good melancholy oft began
Of younger spirits
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
I after him do after him wish too
You are loved
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
I fill a place
He was much famed.
Some six months since
If he were living
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
With several applications; nature and sickness
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome
My son's no dearer.
Thank your majesty.

I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
Madam
wish might be found in the calendar of my past
endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
foul the clearness of our deservings

What does this knave here? Get you gone
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
you lack not folly to commit them
enough to make such knaveries yours.
'Tis not unknown to you
Well
No
many of the rich are damned: but
your ladyship's good will to go to the world
the woman and I will do as we may.
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
I do beg your good will in this case.
In what case?
In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
heritage: and I think I shall never have the
blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
they say barnes are blessings.
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
My poor body

Is this all your worship's reason?

May the world know them?

she wished me: alone she was
to herself her own words to her own ears; she
thought
stranger sense. Her matter was
Fortune
such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no
god
qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins
would suffer her poor knight surprised
rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;
sithence
you something to know it.
You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
before
I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you
for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.

Even so it was with me when I was young:

By our remembrances of days foregone
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.
What is your pleasure
You know
Mine honourable mistress.
Nay
Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother
Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother
That you start at it? I say
And put you in the catalogue of those
That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan
God's mercy
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter
Why? that you are my daughter?
That I am not.
I say
Pardon
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
I am from humble
No note upon my parents
My master
His servant live
He must not be my brother.
Nor I your mother?
You are my mother
So that my lord your son were not my brother
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers
Yes
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
So strive upon your pulse. What
My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
The mystery of your loneliness
Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
You love my son; invention is ashamed
But tell me then
Confess it
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
That in their kind they speak it: only sin
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
If it be so
If it be not
Good madam
Do you love my son?
Your pardon
Love you my son?
Do not you love him
Go not about; my love hath in't a bond
The state of your affection; for your passions
Have to the full appeach'd.
Then
My friends were poor
Be not offended; for it hurts not him
That he is loved of me: I follow him not
By any token of presumptuous suit;
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
Yet never know how that desert should be.
I know I love in vain
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
I still pour in the waters of my love
And lack not to lose still: thus
The sun
For loving where you do: but if yourself
Wish chastely and love dearly
Was both herself and love: O
To her
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
That seeks not to find that her search implies
Had you not lately an intent
To go to Paris?
Madam
Wherefore? tell true.
I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
You know my father left me some prescriptions
Of rare and proved effects
And manifest experience had collected
For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them
More than they were in note: amongst the rest
The king is render'd lost.
This was your motive
For Paris
My lord your son made me to think of this;
Else Paris and the medicine and the king
Had from the conversation of my thoughts
Haply been absent then.
But think you
Are of a mind; he
A poor unlearned virgin
The danger to itself?
There's something in't
Of his profession
Shall for my legacy be sanctified
By the luckiest stars in heaven: and
But give me leave to try success
The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
By such a day and hour.
Dost thou believe't?
Ay
Why
To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this

In what he did profess

Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
Which
And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
With that malignant cause wherein the honour
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power
With all bound humbleness.
We thank you
But may not be so credulous of cure
The congregated college have concluded
That labouring art can never ransom nature
From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
So stain our judgment
To empirics
Our great self and our credit
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
I will no more enforce mine office on you.
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
A modest one
I cannot give thee less
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
As one near death to those that wish him live:
But what at full I know
What I can do can do no hurt to try
He that of greatest works is finisher
Oft does them by the weakest minister:
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
From simple sources
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
Oft expectation fails and most oft there
Where most it promises
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.
I must not hear thee; fare thee well
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
It is not so with Him that all things knows
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
But most it is presumption in us when
The help of heaven we count the act of men.
Dear sir
Of heaven
I am not an impostor that proclaim
Myself against the level of mine aim;
But know I think and think I know most sure
My art is not past power nor you past cure.
Are thou so confident? within what space
Hopest thou my cure?
The great'st grace lending grace
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
Upon thy certainty and confidence
What darest thou venture?
Tax of impudence
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
Sear'd otherwise; nay
With vilest torture let my life be ended.
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
His powerful sound within an organ weak:
And what impossibility would slay
In common sense
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate
That happiness and prime can happy call:
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
Sweet practiser
If I break time
Of what I spoke
But
Make thy demand.
But will you make it even?
Ay
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
What husband in thy power I will command:
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France
With any branch or image of thy state;
But such a one
Is free for me to ask
Here is my hand; the premises observed
So make the choice of thy own time
More should I question thee
Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.

Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
She had her breeding at my father's charge.

Rather corrupt me ever!
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods
In differences so mighty. If she be
All that is virtuous
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed
Where great additions swell's
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
The property by what it is should go
In these to nature she's immediate heir
And is not like the sire: honours thrive
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
Debosh'd on every tomb
A lying trophy
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
If thou canst like this creature as a maid
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
I cannot love her
Thou wrong'st thyself
That you are well restored
Let the rest go.
My honour's at the stake; which to defeat
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
My love and her desert; that canst not dream
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
Obey our will
Believe not thy disdain
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
Loosing upon thee
Pardon

What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it
Was in my nobler thoughts most base

Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?

You are too old
I must tell thee
title age cannot bring thee.
What I dare too well do
I did think thee
wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
have now found thee; when I lose thee again
not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and
that thou't scarce worth.
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger
hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee

I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
lord: whom I serve above is my master.
Who? God?
Ay
The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
honour
thee: methinks
every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
This is hard and undeserved measure
Go to
kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
and honourable personages than the commission of your
birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
worth another word

It shall be so: I'll send her to my house

Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
To the dark house and the detested wife.
Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?

Some private speech with you.
I shall obey his will.
You must not marvel
The ministration and required office
On my particular. Prepared I was not
For such a business; therefore am I found
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
That presently you take our way for home;
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you

So that from point to point now have you heard
The fundamental reasons of this war
And more thirsts after.
Holy seems the quarrel
Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
On the opposer.
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.
Good my lord
By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
Say what I think of it
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
As often as I guess'd.
Be it his pleasure.
But I am sure the younger of our nature
Come here for physic.
Welcome shall they be;
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;

By what observance
Why
ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
Let me see what he writes
Opening a letter
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our

E'en that you have there.

This is not well
To fly the favours of so good a king;
To pluck his indignation on thy head
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
For the contempt of empire.
Re-enter Clown
O madam
soldiers and my young lady!
What is the matter?
Nay
comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
thought he would.
Why should he be killed?

Think upon patience. Pray you
Madam
We met him thitherward; for thence we came
Look on his letter

When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
never shall come off
of thy body that I am father to
husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
This is a dreadful sentence.
Brought you this letter
Ay
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.
I prithee
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine
But I do wash his name out of my blood

And to be a soldier?
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't
That good convenience claims.
Return you thither?

'Tis bitter.
Find you that there?
Ay
'Tis but the boldness of his hand

Nothing in France
There's nothing here that is too good for him
But only she; and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
A servant only
Which I have sometime known.
Parolles
Ay
A very tainted fellow
My son corrupts a well-derived nature
With his inducement.
Indeed
You're welcome
I will entreat you
The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
Written to bear along.
We serve you
Not so
Will you draw near!
Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen
'Till I have no wife
Nothing in France
Thou shalt have none
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
That chase thee from thy country and expose
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
That drive thee from the sportive court
Wast shot at with fair eyes
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers
Whoever shoots at him
Whoever charges on his forward breast
And
His death was so effected: better 'twere
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
That all the miseries which nature owes

Of greatest justice. Write
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
Though little he do feel it

To make distinction: provide this messenger:

SCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.
Enter an old Widow of Florence
Nay

They say the French count has done most honourable service.
It is reported that he has taken their greatest
commander; and that with his own hand he slew the
duke's brother.
Tucket
We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary
way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.
Come
the report of it. Well
French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and
no legacy is so rich as honesty.
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
by a gentleman his companion.
I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a
filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
young earl. Beware of them
lust
hath been seduced by them; and the misery is
maidenhood

I hope your own grace will keep you where you are
modesty which is so lost.
You shall not need to fear me.
I hope so.
Enter HELENA
Look

question her. God save you

Where do the palmers lodge
At the Saint Francis here beside the port.
Is this the way?
Ay
A march afar
Hark you! they come this way.
If you will tarry
The rather
As ample as myself.
Is it yourself?
If you shall please so
I thank you
You came
I did so.
Here you shall see a countryman of yours
That has done worthy service.
His name
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
But by the ear
His face I know not.
Whatsome'er he is
Against his liking: think you it is so?
Ay
There is a gentleman that serves the count
Reports but coarsely of her.
What's his name?
Monsieur Parolles.
O
Of the great count himself
To have her name repeated: all her deserving
Is a reserved honesty
I have not heard examined.
Alas
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
Of a detesting lord.
I warrant
A shrewd turn
How do you mean?
May be the amorous count solicits her
In the unlawful purpose.
He does indeed;
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
In honestest defence.
The gods forbid else!
So
Drum and Colours
Enter BERTRAM
That is Antonio
That
Which is the Frenchman?
He;
That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?
I like him well.
'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
That leads him to these places: were I his lady
Which is he?
That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.
Lose our drum! well.
He's shrewdly vexed at something: look

Worthy the note.
We'll take your offer kindly.

Nay

If your lordship find him not a hilding
more in your respect.
On my life
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
Believe it
kinsman
endless liar
of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
entertainment.
It were fit you knew him; lest
his virtue
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
None better than to let him fetch off his drum
I
surprise him; such I will have
knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
him so
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries
we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
present at his examination: if he do not
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
base fear
intelligence in his power against you
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath
trust my judgment in any thing.
O
he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
lordship sees the bottom of his success in't
what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
melted
entertainment
Here he comes.
Enter PAROLLES
[Aside to BERTRAM]  O
off his drum in any hand.
How now
disposition.
A pox on't
'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
There was excellent command
horse upon our own wings
That was not to be blamed in the command of the
service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
himself could not have prevented
there to command.
Well
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
not to be recovered.
It might have been recovered.
It might; but it is not now.
It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
performer
'hic jacet.'
Why
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
instrument of honour again into his native quarter
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
speed well in it
and extend to you what further becomes his
greatness
worthiness.
By the hand of a soldier
But you must not now slumber in it.
I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
pen down my dilemmas
certainty
and by midnight look to hear further from me.
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?
I know not what the success will be
the attempt I vow.
I know thou'rt valiant; and
thy soldiership
I love not many words.
Exit
No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
strange fellow
to undertake this business
be done; damns himself to do and dares better be
damned than to do't?
You do not know him
is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but
when you find him out
Why
this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
None in the world; but return with an invention and
clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall
to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.
We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
when his disguise and he is parted
sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this
very night.
I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
Your brother he shall go along with me.
As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.
Exit
Now will I lead you to the house
The lass I spoke of.
But you say she's honest.
That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
Will you go see her?
With all my heart
Exeunt
SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.
Enter HELENA and Widow
If you misdoubt me that I am not she
Though my estate be fallen
And would not put my reputation now
In any staining act.
Nor would I wish you.
First
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot
I should believe you:
For you have show'd me that which well approves
You're great in fortune.
Take this purse of gold
When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter
Now his important blood will nought deny
That she'll demand: a ring the county wears
From son to son
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire
Now I see
The bottom of your purpose.
You see it lawful
In fine
To what is passed already.
I have yielded:
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever
May prove coherent. Every night he comes
With musics of all sorts and songs composed
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
As if his life lay on't.
Why then to-night
Let us assay our plot; which
And lawful meaning in a lawful act
But let's about it.

He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
When you sally upon him
language you will: though you understand it not

Good captain
Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?
No
But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
E'en such as you speak to me.
He must think us some band of strangers i' the
adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every
one be a man of his own fancy
speak one to another; so we seem to know
know straight our purpose: choughs' language
Enter PAROLLES
Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
done? It must be a very plausive invention that
carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the
fear of Mars before it and of his creatures
daring the reports of my tongue.
This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
was guilty of.
What the devil should move me to undertake the
recovery of this drum
impossibility
must give myself some hurts
exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
will say
ones I dare not give. Wherefore
instance? Tongue
butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
Bajazet's mule
Is it possible he should know what he is
that he is?
I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
turn
We cannot afford you so.
Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
stratagem.
'Twould not do.
Or to drown my clothes
Hardly serve.
Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
How deep?
Thirty fathom.
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
I recovered it.

Exeunt
SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.
Enter BERTRAM and DIANA
They told me that your name was Fontibell.
No
Titled goddess;
And worth it
If quick fire of youth light not your mind
When you are dead
As you are now
And now you should be as your mother was
When your sweet self was got.
She then was honest.
So should you be.
No:
My mother did but duty; such
No more o' that;
I prithee
I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
By love's own sweet constraint
Do thee all rights of service.
Ay
Till we serve you; but when you have our roses
And mock us with our bareness.
How have I sworn!
'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth
What is not holy
Are words and poor conditions
Change it
Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off
My love as it begins shall so persever.
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
I'll lend it thee
To give it from me.
Will you not
It is an honour 'longing to our house
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
In me to lose.
Mine honour's such a ring:
My chastity's the jewel of our house
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
Brings in the champion Honour on my part
Here
My house
When midnight comes
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
Now will I charge you in the band of truth
My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
And on your finger in the night I'll put
Another ring
May token to the future our past deeds.
Adieu
A wife of me
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
Exit
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
You may so in the end.
My mother told me just how he would woo
Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid
Only in this disguise I think't no sin
To cozen him that would unjustly win.
Exit
SCENE III. The Florentine camp.
Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers
You have not given him his mother's letter?
I have delivered it an hour since: there is
something in't that stings his nature; for on the
reading it he changed almost into another man.
He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
displeasure of the king
bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
thing
When you have spoken it
grave of it.
He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
Florence
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
given her his monumental ring
made in the unchaste composition.
Now
Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
of all treasons
themselves
nobility
Is it not meant damnable in us
our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
company to-night?
Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
his company anatomized
of his own judgments
set this counterfeit.
We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
presence must be the whip of the other.
In the mean time
I hear there is an overture of peace.
Nay
What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
higher
I perceive
of his council.
Let it be forbid
of his act.
Sir
house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
sanctimony she accomplished; and
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
grief; in fine
now she sings in heaven.
How is this justified?
The stronger part of it by her own letters
makes her story true
death: her death itself
office to say is come
the rector of the place.
Hath the count all this intelligence?
Ay
point
I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
with a shame as ample.
The web of our life is of a mingled yarn
ill together: our virtues would be proud
faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
despair
Enter a Messenger
How now! where's your master?
He met the duke in the street
taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
morning for France. The duke hath offered him
letters of commendations to the king.
They shall be no more than needful there
were more than they can commend.
They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
Here's his lordship now.
Enter BERTRAM
How now
I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses
month's length a-piece
I have congied with the duke
nearest; buried a wife
lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
many nicer needs; the last was the greatest
that I have not ended yet.
If the business be of any difficulty
morning your departure hence
your lordship.
I mean
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come
me
Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night
No matter: his heels have deserved it
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
I have told your lordship already
him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
hath confessed himself to Morgan
to be a friar
this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
Nothing of me
His confession is taken
face: if your lordship be in't
are

You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
And truly
[Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the
duke is strong.' What say you to that?
Five or six thousand; but very weak and
unserviceable: the troops are all scattered
the commanders very poor rogues
and credit and as I hope to live.
Shall I set down your answer so?
Do: I'll take the sacrament on't
All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
You're deceived

I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword

But I con him no thanks for't

'You shall demand of him

do you know of it?
I beseech you
the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
Do you know this Captain Dumain?
I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris

Nay
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
Well
Upon my knowledge
Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
lordship anon.
What is his reputation with the duke?
The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.
Marry
In good sadness
in my tent.
Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?
I do not know if it be it or no.

Excellently.

In me at once: but to the brightest beams
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
The time is fair again.
My high-repented blames
All is whole;
Not one word more of the consumed time.
Let's take the instant by the forward top;
For we are old
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
The daughter of this lord?
Admiringly
I stuck my choice upon her
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
Where the impression of mine eye infixing
Scorn'd a fair colour
Extended or contracted all proportions
To a most hideous object: thence it came
That she whom all men praised and whom myself
The dust that did offend it.
Well excused:
That thou didst love her
From the great compt: but love that comes too late
Make trivial price of serious things we have
Oft our displeasures
Our own love waking cries to see what's done
Be this sweet Helen's knell
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
To see our widower's second marriage-day.
Which better than the first
Or
Come on
Must be digested
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
BERTRAM gives a ring
By my old beard
Hers it was not.

This ring was mine; and
Necessitied to help
I would relieve her. Had you that craft
her
Of what should stead her most?
My gracious sovereign
Son
At her life's rate.
I am sure I saw her wear it.
You are deceived
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me
Of her that threw it: noble she was
I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
I could not answer in that course of honour
As she had made the overture
In heavy satisfaction and would never
Receive the ring again.
Plutus himself
Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine
That you are well acquainted with yourself
You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
That she would never put it from her finger
Upon her great disaster.
She never saw it.
Thou speak'st it falsely
And makest conjectural fears to come into me
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
That thou art so inhuman
And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly
Her eyes myself
Guards seize BERTRAM
My fore-past proofs
We'll sift this matter further.
If you shall prove
This ring was ever hers
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence

To tender it herself. I undertook it

I am her mother
Both suffer under this complaint we bring
Come hither
My lord
But that I know them: do they charge me further?
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
She's none of mine
If you shall marry
You give away heaven's vows
You give away myself
For I by vow am so embodied yours
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
are no husband for her.
My lord
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
Than for to think that I would sink it here.
Sir
Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
Than in my thought it lies.
Good my lord
He had not my virginity.
What say'st thou to her?
She's impudent
He does me wrong
Do not believe him. O
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
He gave it to a commoner o' the camp
He blushes
Of six preceding ancestors
That ring's a thousand proofs.
Methought you said
You saw one here in court could witness it.
I did
So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.
I saw the man to-day
Find him
Exit an Attendant
What of him?
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter
She hath that ring of yours.
I think she has: certain it is I liked her
She knew her distance and did angle for me
Are motives of more fancy; and
And I had that which any inferior might
At market-price have bought.
I must be patient:
You
Since you lack virtue
Send for your ring
I have it not.
What ring was yours
Sir
The same upon your finger.
Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
And this was it I gave him
The story then goes false
Out of a casement.
I have spoke the truth.
Enter PAROLLES
My lord
You boggle shrewdly
Is this the man you speak of?
Ay
Tell me
So please your majesty
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him
Come
Faith
How
He did love her
How is that?
He loved her
As thou art a knave
equivocal companion is this!
I am a poor man
He's a good drum
Do you know he promised me marriage?
Faith
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
Yes
indeed he was mad for her
of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
was in that credit with them at that time that I
knew of their going to bed
derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
speak what I know.
Thou hast spoken all already
they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
evidence; therefore stand aside.
This ring
Ay
Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?
It was not given me
Who lent it you?
It was not lent me neither.
Where did you find it
I found it not.
If it were yours by none of all these ways
I never gave it him.
This woman's an easy glove
and on at pleasure.
This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.
It might be yours or hers
Take her away; I do not like her now;
To prison with her: and away with him.
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring
I'll never tell you.
Take her away.
I'll put in bail
I think thee now some common customer.
By Jove
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
Because he's guilty
He knows I am no maid
I'll swear I am a maid
Great king
I am either maid
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.
Good mother
Exit Widow
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
And at that time he got his wife with child:
Dead though she be
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
And now behold the meaning.

Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
Is't real that I see?

Let thy courtesies alone
Let us from point to point this story know

Can you tell if Rosalind

O

to stay behind her. She is at the court
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
never two ladies loved as they do.
Where will the old duke live?
They say he is already in the forest of Arden
a many merry men with him; and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day
carelessly
What
Marry

that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.

must
withal
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into
and altogether against my will.

thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from

it is the stubbornest young fellow of France
of ambition

me his natural brother: therefore use thy
discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
mightily grace himself on thee
against thee by poison
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
for
it

Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
Nature's wit.
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither
Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull

speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
one of these days.
The more pity
wise men do foolishly.
By my troth
wit that fools have was silenced

Monsieur Le Beau.
With his mouth full of news.

Then shall we be news-crammed.
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
Enter LE BEAU
Bon jour
Fair princess
Sport! of what colour?
What colour
As wit and fortune will.
Or as the Destinies decree.
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
Nay
Thou losest thy old smell.
You amaze me
wrestling
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
I will tell you the beginning; and
your ladyships
yet to do; and here
to perform it.
Well
There comes an old man and his three sons
I could match this beginning with an old tale.
Three proper young men
With bills on their necks
by these presents.'
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles
duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs
hope of life in him: so he served the second
so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
Alas!
But what is the sport
have lost?
Why
Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies.
Or I
But is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling
You must
appointed for the wrestling
perform it.
Yonder
Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK
Come on: since the youth will not be entreated
own peril on his forwardness.
Is yonder the man?
Even he
Alas
How now
to see the wrestling?
Ay
You will take little delight in it
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him
will not be entreated. Speak to him
you can move him.
Call him hither
Do so: I'll not be by.
Monsieur the challenger
I attend them with all respect and duty.
Young man
No
come but in
strength of my youth.
Young gentleman
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise. We pray you
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
Do
be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
that the wrestling might not go forward.
I beseech you

so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
trial: wherein if I be foiled
shamed that was never gracious; if killed
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
friends no wrong
world no injury
the world I fill up a place
supplied when I have made it empty.
The little strength that I have
And mine
Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
Your heart's desires be with you!
Come
desirous to lie with his mother earth?
Ready
You shall try but one fall.
No
to a second
from a first.
An you mean to mock me after
mocked me before: but come your ways.
Now Hercules be thy speed
I would I were invisible
fellow by the leg.

O excellent young man!
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye

Shout. CHARLES is thrown
No more
Yes
How dost thou
He cannot speak
Bear him away. What is thy name
Orlando
I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
The world esteem'd thy father honourable
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
I would thou hadst told me of another father.
Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK
Were I my father
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul
Had I before known this young man his son
Gentle cousin
My father's rough and envious disposition
Sticks me at heart. Sir
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly
Gentleman
Wear this for me
Shall we go
Ay. Fare you well
Can I not say
Are all thrown down
Is but a quintain
He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call
Sir
More than your enemies.
Will you go
Have with you. Fare you well.
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her
O poor Orlando
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
Re-enter LE BEAU
Good sir
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
High commendation
That he misconstrues all that you have done.
The duke is humorous; what he is indeed
I thank you
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
That here was at the wrestling?
Neither his daughter
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
But I can tell you that of late this duke
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece
But that the people praise her for her virtues
And pity her for her good father's sake;
And
Will suddenly break forth. Sir
Hereafter
I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
Exit LE BEAU
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
But heavenly Rosalind!

SCENE III. A room in the palace.
Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
Why
Not one to throw at a dog.
No
curs; throw some of them at me; come
Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
without any.
But is all this for your father?
No
full of briers is this working-day world!
They are but burs
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them.
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
Hem them away.
I would try
Come

O
despite of a fall. But

possible
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
The duke my father loved his father dearly.
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
dearly? By this kind of chase
not Orlando.
No
Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
Let me love him for that
because I do. Look
With his eyes full of anger.
Enter DUKE FREDERICK
Mistress
And get you from our court.
Me
You
Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
So near our public court as twenty miles
I do beseech your grace
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires
As I do trust I am not--then
Did I offend your highness.
Thus do all traitors:
If their purgation did consist in words
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banish'd him:
Treason is not inherited
Or
Then
To think my poverty is treacherous.
Dear sovereign
Ay
I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;
But now I know her: if she be a traitor
She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness
Speak to the people
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
Pronounce that sentence then on me
I cannot live out of her company.
You are a fool. You
If you outstay the time
Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords
O my poor Rosalind
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
I charge thee
I have more cause.
Thou hast not
Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not
Hath banish'd me
That he hath not.
No
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part
No: let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly
And do not seek to take your change upon you
For
Why
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
Alas
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
The like do you: so shall we pass along
And never stir assailants.
Were it not better
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside
That do outface it with their semblances.
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be call'd?
Something that hath a reference to my state
No longer Celia
But
The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight. Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment.
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.
Enter DUKE SENIOR
Now
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
Sweet are the uses of adversity
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees
I would not change it.
Happy is your grace
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
Come
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
Have their round haunches gored.
Indeed
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
To the which place a poor sequester'd stag
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques
But what said Jaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
O
First
'Poor deer
As worldlings do
To that which had too much:' then
The flux of company:' anon a careless herd
And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques
'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
The body of the country
Are mere usurpers
In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
We did
Upon the sobbing deer.
Show me the place:
I love to cope him in these sullen fits
I'll bring you to him straight.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A room in the palace.
Enter DUKE FREDERICK
Can it be possible that no man saw them?
It cannot be: some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this.
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
The ladies
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
My lord
Your grace was wont to laugh
Hisperia
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
The parts and graces of the wrestler
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
And she believes
Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
If he be absent
I'll make him find him: do this suddenly
To bring again these foolish runaways.
Exeunt
SCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house.
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
Who's there?
What
O my sweet master! O you memory
Of old Sir Rowland! why
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours: your virtues
O
Envenoms him that bears it!
Why
O unhappy youth!
Come not within these doors; within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives:
Your brother--no
Yet not the son
Of him I was about to call his father--
Hath heard your praises
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
And you within it: if he fail of that
I overheard him and his practises.
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
Abhor it
Why
No matter whither
What
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
A thievish living on the common road?
This I must do
Yet this I will not do
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
But do not so. I have five hundred crowns
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
And unregarded age in corners thrown:
Take that
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
Though I look old
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
The means of weakness and debility;
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter
I'll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.
O good old man
The constant service of the antique world
Thou art not for the fashion of these times
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
But
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
But come thy ways; well go along together
Master
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Here lived I
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
But at fourscore it is too late a week:
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden.
Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede
O Jupiter
I care not for my spirits
I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort
the weaker vessel
itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage
I pray you
For my part
you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you
Well
Ay
at home
must be content.
Ay
Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
Look you
solemn talk.
That is the way to make her scorn you still.
O Corin
I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.
No
As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
But if thy love were ever like to mine--
As sure I think did never man love so--
How many actions most ridiculous
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
O
If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
That ever love did make thee run into
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now
Or if thou hast not broke from company
Abruptly
O Phebe
Exit
Alas
And I mine. I remember
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
wooing of a peascod instead of her
two cods and
weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
mortal in nature
Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
Nay
break my shins against it.
Jove
Is much upon my fashion.
And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
I pray you
If he for gold will give us any food:
I faint almost to death.
Holla
Peace
Who calls?
Your betters
Else are they very wretched.
Peace
And to you
I prithee
Can in this desert place buy entertainment
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
And faints for succor.
Fair sir
And wish
But I am shepherd to another man
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
My master is of churlish disposition
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality:
Besides
Are now on sale
That you will feed on; but what is
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
I pray thee
And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
And willingly could waste my time in it.
Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
Go with me: if you like upon report
The soil
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

SONG.
Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me
Unto the sweet bird's throat
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather.

It will make you melancholy
I thank it. More
melancholy out of a song
More
My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
sing. Come
What you will
Nay
nothing. Will you sing?
More at your request than to please myself.
Well then
but that they call compliment is like the encounter
of two dog-apes
the beggarly thanks. Come
not
Well
duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
this day to look you.
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
too disputable for my company: I think of as many
matters as he
boast of them. Come
SONG.
Who doth ambition shun
All together here
And loves to live i' the sun
And pleased with what he gets
Here shall he see No enemy
But winter and rough weather.
I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
yesterday in despite of my invention.
And I'll sing it.
Thus it goes:--
If it do come to pass
That any man turn ass
Here shall he see
Gross fools as he

rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

SCENE VI. The forest.
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
Dear master
Here lie I down
Why
a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage
will either be food for it or bring it for food to
thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
and if I bring thee not something to eat
give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
come
thou lookest cheerly
Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come
thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
lack of a dinner
desert. Cheerly
Exeunt
SCENE VII. The forest.
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR
I think he be transform'd into a beast;
For I can no where find him like a man.
My lord
Here was he merry
If he
Go
Enter JAQUES
He saves my labour by his own approach.
Why
What
A fool
As I do live by food
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun
'Good morrow
And then he drew a dial from his poke
Thus we may see
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
And so
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
The motley fool thus moral on the time
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
What fool is this?
O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier
After a voyage
With observation
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
Thou shalt have one.
It is my only suit;
Provided that you weed your better judgments
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise. I must have liberty
Withal
And they that are most galled with my folly
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Doth very foolishly
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley; give me leave
To speak my mind
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world
Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
What
Most mischievous foul sin
For thou thyself hast been a libertine
And all the embossed sores and headed evils
Why
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
What woman in the city do I name
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
Who can come in and say that I mean her
Or what is he of basest function
That says his bravery is not of my cost
His folly to the mettle of my speech?
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right
Enter ORLANDO
Forbear
Why
Nor shalt not
Of what kind should this cock come of?
Art thou thus bolden'd
You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
And know some nurture. But forbear
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered.
An you will not be answered with reason
What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness.
I almost die for food; and let me have it.
Sit down and feed
Speak you so gently? Pardon me
I thought that all things had been savage here;
And therefore put I on the countenance
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
That in this desert inaccessible
If ever you have look'd on better days
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied
In the which hope I blush
True is it that we have seen better days
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be minister'd.
Then but forbear your food a little while
And give it food. There is an old poor man
Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed
Go find him out
I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
Exit
Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
This wide and universal theatre
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in.
All the world's a stage
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts
And then the whining school-boy
And shining morning face
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all
Re-enter ORLANDO
Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen
I thank you most for him.
So had you need:
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
As yet
Give us some music; and

Thou art not so unkind
As man's ingratitude;
Thy tooth is not so keen
Heigh-ho! sing
Most friendship is feigning
Then
This life is most jolly.
Freeze
As benefits forgot:
Though thou the waters warp
As friend remember'd not.
Heigh-ho! sing

Most truly limn'd and living in your face
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand

Enter DUKE FREDERICK
Not see him since? Sir
But were I not the better part made mercy
Of my revenge
Find out thy brother
Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
Within this twelvemonth
To seek a living in our territory.
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
Worth seizure do we seize into our hands
Of what we think against thee.
O that your highness knew my heart in this!
I never loved my brother in my life.
More villain thou. Well
And let my officers of such a nature
Make an extent upon his house and lands:
Do this expediently and turn him going.
Exeunt

That every eye which in this forest looks
Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
Run

Exit
Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
And how like you this shepherd's life
Truly
life
like it very well; but in respect that it is
private
is in the fields
respect it is not in the court
is it a spare life
but as there is no more plenty in it
against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee
No more but that I know the more one sickens the
worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep
great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
court
No
Then thou art damned.
Nay
Truly
on one side.
For not being at court? Your reason.
Why
good manners; if thou never sawest good manners
sin
state
Not a whit
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
court. You told me you salute not at the court
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
uncleanly
Instance
Why
fells
Why
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
a man? Shallow
Besides
Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
A more sounder instance
And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
Most shallow man! thou worms-meat
good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise
perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar
very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance
You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee
God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
Sir
that I wear
happiness
harm
graze and my lambs suck.
That is another simple sin in you
and the rams together and to offer to get your
living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
bell-wether
twelvemonth to a crooked-pated
damned for this
shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
'scape.
Here comes young Master Ganymede
Enter ROSALIND
From the east to western Ind
Her worth
All the pictures fairest lined
Are but black to Rosalind.
Let no fair be kept in mind
But the fair of Rosalind.
I'll rhyme you so eight years together
suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
right butter-women's rank to market.
Out
For a taste:
If a hart do lack a hind
If the cat will after kind
Winter garments must be lined
They that reap must sheaf and bind;
Then to cart with Rosalind.
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind
He that sweetest rose will find
Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
infect yourself with them?
Peace
Truly
I'll graff it with you
with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
ripe
You have said; but whether wisely or no

lamely in the verse.
But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name

Orlando.
Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
him again? Answer me in one word.
You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
answer in a catechism.
But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
day he wrestled?
It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
finding him
I found him under a tree
It may well be called Jove's tree
forth such fruit.
Give me audience
Proceed.
There lay he
Though it be pity to see such a sight
becomes the ground.
Cry 'holla' to thy tongue
unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
O
I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
me out of tune.
Do you not know I am a woman? when I think
speak. Sweet
You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
'Tis he: slink by
I thank you for your company; but
as lief have been myself alone.
And so had I; but yet
too for your society.
God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
I do desire we may be better strangers.
I pray you
love-songs in their barks.
I pray you
them ill-favouredly.
Rosalind is your love's name?
Yes
I do not like her name.
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
christened.
What stature is she of?
Just as high as my heart.
You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
acquainted with goldsmiths' wives
out of rings?
Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth
whence you have studied your questions.
You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery.
I will chide no breather in the world but myself
The worst fault you have is to be in love.
'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
I am weary of you.
By my troth
you.
He is drowned in the brook: look but in
shall see him.
There I shall see mine own figure.
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell
Signior Love.
I am glad of your departure: adieu
Melancholy.
Exit JAQUES
[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
Do you hear
Very well: what would you?
I pray you
You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
in the forest.
Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
been as proper?
By no means
divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
withal
withal and who he stands still withal.
I prithee
Marry
contract of her marriage and the day it is
solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight
seven year.
Who ambles Time withal?
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
hath not the gout
he cannot study
he feels no pain
and wasteful learning
of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
Who doth he gallop withal?
With a thief to the gallows
softly as foot can fall
Who stays it still withal?
With lawyers in the vacation
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
Where dwell you
With this shepherdess
skirts of the forest
Are you native of this place?
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
Your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling.
I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak
in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
too well
him read many lectures against it
I am not a woman
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal.
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women?
There were none principal; they were all like one
another as half-pence are
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
I prithee
No
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest
abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
give him some good counsel
quotidian of love upon him.
I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
your remedy.
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
What were his marks?
A lean cheek
sunken
spirit
simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
revenue: then your hose should be ungartered
bonnet unbanded
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
Fair youth
Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
love believe it; which
do than to confess she does: that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences. But
that hangs the verses on the trees
is so admired?
I swear to thee
Rosalind
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
Love is merely a madness
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
Did you ever cure any so?
Yes
his love
woo me: at which time would I
youth
and liking
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing
cattle of this colour; would now like him
him; then entertain him
for him
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness; which was
the world
And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
heart
I would not be cured
I would cure you
and come every day to my cote and woo me.
Now
where it is.
Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
Will you go?
With all my heart
Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come

Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

Never talk to me; I will weep.

But have I not cause to weep?
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
Something browner than Judas's marry
Judas's own children.
I' faith
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
of holy bread.
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
the very ice of chastity is in them.
But why did he swear he would come this morning
comes not?
Nay
Do you think so?
Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
horse-stealer
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
worm-eaten nut.
Not true in love?
Yes
You have heard him swear downright he was.
'Was' is not 'is:' besides
no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
here in the forest on the duke your father.
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
him

Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
Sweet Phebe
Say that you love me not
In bitterness. The common executioner
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
Enter ROSALIND
I would not be thy executioner:
I fly thee
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
'Tis pretty
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
And if mine eyes can wound
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
Or if thou canst not
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
Scratch thee but with a pin
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes
That can do hurt.
O dear Phebe
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
That love's keen arrows make.
But till that time
Come not thou near me: and when that time comes
As till that time I shall not pity thee.
And why
As
Than without candle may go dark to bed--
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life
No
'Tis not your inky brows
You foolish shepherd
You are a thousand times a properer man
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
'Tis not her glass
And out of you she sees herself more proper
Than any of her lineaments can show her.
But
For I must tell you friendly in your ear
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
Foul is most foul
So take her to thee
Sweet youth
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
fall in love with my anger. If it be so
she answers thee with frowning looks
with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
For no ill will I bear you.
I pray you
Besides
Will you go

Dead Shepherd
Sweet Phebe
Ha
Sweet Phebe
Why
Wherever sorrow is
If you do sorrow at my grief in love
Were both extermined.
Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
I would have you.
Why
Silvius
But since that thou canst talk of love so well
But do not look for further recompense
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
So holy and so perfect is my love
To glean the broken ears after the man
That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
A scatter'd smile
Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
Not very well
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
That the old carlot once was master of.
Think not I love him
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
But what care I for words? yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
But
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
There was a pretty redness in his lip
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
Between the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women
In parcels as I did
To fall in love with him; but
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
And
I marvel why I answer'd not again:
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
I'll write to him a very taunting letter
Phebe
I'll write it straight;
The matter's in my head and in my heart:
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Go with me

A traveller! By my faith

Of a snail?

What's that?
Why

his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
And I am your Rosalind.
It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
Rosalind of a better leer than you.
Come
humour and like enough to consent. What would you
say to me now
I would kiss before I spoke.
Nay
gravelled for lack of matter

How if the kiss be denied?
Then she puts you to entreaty
Who could be out
Marry
I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
What
Not out of your apparel
Am not I your Rosalind?
I take some joy to say you are
talking of her.
Well in her person I say I will not have you.
Then in mine own person I die.
No
almost six thousand years old
there was not any man died in his own person
dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
could to die before
of love. Leander
year
for a hot midsummer night; for
but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
But these are all lies: men have died from time to
time and worms have eaten them
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind
By this hand
I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
disposition

Then love me
Yes
And wilt thou have me?
Ay
What sayest thou?
Are you not good?
I hope so.
Why then
Come
Give me your hand
Pray thee
I cannot say the words.
You must begin
Go to. Will you
I will.
Ay
Why now; as fast as she can marry us.
Then you must say 'I take thee
I take thee
I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
thee
before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
runs before her actions.
So do all thoughts; they are winged.
Now tell me how long you would have her after you
have possessed her.
For ever and a day.
Say 'a day
men are April when they woo
maids are May when they are maids
changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen
new-fangled than an ape
than a monkey: I will weep for nothing
in the fountain
disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen
that when thou art inclined to sleep.
But will my Rosalind do so?
By my life
O
Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
wiser
wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
'twill out at the key-hole; stop that
with the smoke out at the chimney.
A man that had a wife with such a wit
'Wit
Nay
your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
Marry
never take her without her answer
her without her tongue. O
make her fault her husband's occasion
never nurse her child herself
it like a fool!
For these two hours
Alas! dear love
I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
will be with thee again.

pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover

My errand is to you
My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
I know not the contents; but
By the stern brow and waspish action
Which she did use as she was writing of it
I am but as a guiltless messenger.
Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer; bear this
She says I am not fair
She calls me proud
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
Why writes she so to me? Well
No
Phebe did write it.
Come
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
That her old gloves were on
She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
I say she never did invent this letter;
This is a man's invention and his hand.
Sure
Why
A style for-challengers; why
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
Such Ethiope words
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
So please you
Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
Reads
Art thou god to shepherd turn'd
Can a woman rail thus?
Call you this railing?
[Reads]
Why
Did you ever hear such railing?
Whiles the eye of man did woo me
Meaning me a beast.
If the scorn of your bright eyne
Have power to raise such love in mine
Would they work in mild aspect!
Whiles you chid me
How then might your prayers move!
He that brings this love to thee
Little knows this love in me:
And by him seal up thy mind;
Whether that thy youth and kind
Will the faithful offer take
Of me and all that I can make;
Or else by him my love deny
Call you this chiding?
Alas
Do you pity him? no
thou love such a woman? What
instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
be endured! Well
love hath made thee a tame snake
her: that if she love me
thee; if she will not
thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover

Good morrow
A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?
West of this place
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
There's none within.
If that an eye may profit by a tongue
Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair
Like a ripe sister: the woman low
And browner than her brother.' Are not you
The owner of the house I did inquire for?
It is no boast
Orlando doth commend him to you both
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
I am: what must we understand by this?
Some of my shame; if you will know of me
What man I am
This handkercher was stain'd.
I pray you
When last the young Orlando parted from you
He left a promise to return again
Within an hour
Under an oak
And high top bald with dry antiquity
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly
Into a bush: under which bush's shade
A lioness
The royal disposition of that beast
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
This seen
And found it was his brother
O
And he did render him the most unnatural
That lived amongst men.
And well he might so do
But
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
But kindness
From miserable slumber I awaked.
Are you his brother?
Wast you he rescued?
Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
"'Twas I; but 'tis not I	I do not shame"
To tell you what I was
So sweetly tastes
But
By and by.
When from the first to last betwixt us two
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed
In brief
Who led me instantly unto his cave
The lioness had torn some flesh away
And cried
Brief
And
His broken promise
Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to

Ay
O

and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came
overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
met but they looked
loved
sighed but they asked one another the reason
sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
to marriage which they will climb incontinent
else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs
cannot part them.
They shall be married to-morrow

is to look into happiness through another man's
eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
the height of heart-heaviness

I can live no longer by thinking.
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
Know of me then
speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
of my knowledge
neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
some little measure draw a belief from you
yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then
you please
magician
damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
as your gesture cries it out
marries Aliena
what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
not impossible to me
to you
as she is and without any danger.
Speakest thou in sober meanings?
By my life
say I am a magician. Therefore
best array: bid your friends; for if you will be
married to-morrow
Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
Look
Youth
I care not if I have: it is my study
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
Look upon him
Good shepherd
It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
And so am I for Phebe.
And I for Ganymede.
And I for Rosalind.
And I for no woman.
It is to be all made of faith and service;
And so am I for Phebe.
And I for Ganymede.
And I for Rosalind.
And I for no woman.
It is to be all made of fantasy
And so am I for Phebe.
And so am I for Ganymede.
And so am I for Rosalind.
And so am I for no woman.
If this be so
If this be so
If this be so
Who do you speak to
To her that is not here
Pray you

To SILVIUS
I will help you
To PHEBE
I would love you
To PHEBE
I will marry you
married to-morrow:
To ORLANDO
I will satisfy you
shall be married to-morrow:
To SILVIUS
I will content you

To ORLANDO
As you love Rosalind
To SILVIUS
as you love Phebe
I'll not fail
Nor I.

SCENE III. The forest.
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
To-morrow is the joyful day
we be married.
I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is
no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.

Well met
By my troth
We are for you: sit i' the middle.

SONG.
It was a lover and his lass
In the spring time
Sweet lovers love the spring.
Between the acres of the rye
These pretty country folks would lie
This carol they began that hour
In spring time
And therefore take the present time
For love is crowned with the prime
In spring time
Truly
matter in the ditty
untuneable.
You are deceived
By my troth
such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend
your voices! Come

Dost thou believe
Can do all this that he hath promised?
I sometimes do believe
As those that fear they hope
Enter ROSALIND
Patience once more
You say
That would I
And you say
That would I
You say
That will I
But if you do refuse to marry me
So is the bargain.
You say
Though to have her and death were both one thing.
I have promised to make all this matter even.
Keep you your word
You yours
Keep your word
Keep your word
If she refuse me: and from hence I go
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
I do remember in this shepherd boy
Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
My lord
Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
But
Of many desperate studies by his uncle
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
There is
couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
very strange beasts
Salutation and greeting to you all!
Good my lord
motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
the forest: he hath been a courtier
If any man doubt that
purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
a lady; I have been politic with my friend
with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
had four quarrels
And how was that ta'en up?
Faith
seventh cause.
How seventh cause? Good my lord
I like him very well.
God 'ild you
press in here
copulatives
marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin
humour of mine
will: rich honesty dwells like a miser
poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.
By my faith
According to the fool's bolt
But
quarrel on the seventh cause?
Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
seeming
cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word
mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut
would send me word
this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
not well cut
called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
well cut
is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
well cut
Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial
measured swords and parted.
Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
O sir
books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
The first
Quip Modest; the third
fourth
Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth
Circumstance; the seventh
these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
avoid that too
justices could not take up a quarrel
parties were met themselves
of an If
they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
only peacemaker; much virtue in If.
Is not this a rare fellow
any thing and yet a fool.
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
Enter HYMEN
Still Music
Then is there mirth in heaven
Atone together.
Good duke
Hymen from heaven brought her
Whose heart within his bosom is.
[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself
To ORLANDO
To you I give myself
If there be truth in sight
If there be truth in sight
If sight and shape be true
I'll have no father
I'll have no husband
Nor ne'er wed woman
Peace
'Tis I must make conclusion
Of these most strange events:
Here's eight that must take hands
To join in Hymen's bands
You and you no cross shall part:
You and you are heart in heart
You to his love must accord
You and you are sure together
Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing
That reason wonder may diminish
SONG.
Wedding is great Juno's crown:
O blessed bond of board and bed!
'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
High wedlock then be honoured:
Honour
O my dear niece
Even daughter
I will not eat my word
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
Enter JAQUES DE BOYS
Let me have audience for a word or two:
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland
Duke Frederick
Men of great worth resorted to this forest
His brother here and put him to the sword:
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
Where meeting with an old religious man
Both from his enterprise and from the world
That were with him exiled. This to be true
Welcome
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
To one his lands withheld
A land itself at large
First
That here were well begun and well begot:
And after
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
Shall share the good of our returned fortune
Meantime
And fall into our rustic revelry.
Play
Sir
And thrown into neglect the pompous court?
He hath.
To him will I : out of these convertites
There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
To DUKE SENIOR
You to your former honour I bequeath;
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:
To ORLANDO
You to a love that your true faith doth merit:
To OLIVER
You to your land and love and great allies:
To SILVIUS
You to a long and well-deserved bed:
To TOUCHSTONE
And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
Is but for two months victuall'd. So
I am for other than for dancing measures.
Stay
"To see no pastime I	what you would have"
I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.
Exit
Proceed
A dance
EPILOGUE
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
no bush
epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes
epilogues. What a case am I in then
neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
furnished like a beggar
become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin
with the women. I charge you
you bear to men
please you: and I charge you
you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering
women the play may please. If I were a woman I
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
me
defied not: and
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will
kind offer

The triple pillar of the world transform'd

If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His powerful mandate to you
Take in that kingdom
Perform 't
How
Perchance! nay
You must not stay here longer
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen
Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
Let Rome in Tiber melt
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
Embracing
And such a twain can do't
We stand up peerless.
Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia
I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
Will be himself.
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
Now
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
Hear the ambassadors.
Fie
Whom every thing becomes
To make itself
No messenger
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people. Come
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
Sir
Which still should go with Antony.
I am full sorry
That he approves the common liar
Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
Cleopatra's health to drink.
Good sir

Pray
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

Wrinkles forbid!
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
Hush!
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
Nay
Good now
to three kings in a forenoon
let me have a child at fifty
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
Caesar
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach.
Then belike my children shall have no names:
prithee
If every of your wishes had a womb.
And fertile every wish
Out
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
Nay
We'll know all our fortunes.

There's a palm presages chastity
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
Go
Nay

Your fortunes are alike.
But how
I have said.
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
Well

Hush! here comes Antony.
Not he; the queen.
Enter CLEOPATRA
Saw you my lord?
No
Was he not here?
No
He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
Madam?

Where's Alexas?

We will not look upon him: go with us.
Exeunt
Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
Against my brother Lucius?
Ay:
But soon that war had end
Made friends of them
Whose better issue in the war
Well
The nature of bad news infects the teller.
When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
Who tells me true
Labienus--
This is stiff news--hath
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--
Antony
O
Speak to me home
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter. O
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
At your noble pleasure.
Exit
From Sicyon
The man from Sicyon
He stays upon your will.
Let him appear.
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break
Enter another Messenger
What are you?
Fulvia thy wife is dead.
Where died she?
In Sicyon:
Her length of sickness
Importeth thee to know
Gives a letter
Forbear me.
Exit Second Messenger
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
What our contempt doth often hurl from us
The opposite of itself: she's good
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
I must from this enchanting queen break off:
Ten thousand harms
Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
What's your pleasure
I must with haste from hence.
Why
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
if they suffer our departure
I must be gone.
Under a compelling occasion
pity to cast them away for nothing; though
them and a great cause
nothing. Cleopatra
this
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
mettle in death
her
She is cunning past man's thought.
Exit ALEXAS
Alack
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
cannot be cunning in her; if it be
shower of rain as well as Jove.
Would I had never seen her.
O
of work; which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel.
Fulvia is dead.
Sir?
Fulvia is dead.
Fulvia!
Dead.
Why
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him
comforting therein
out
no more women but Fulvia
with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow.
The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence.
And the business you have broached here cannot be
without you; especially that of Cleopatra's
wholly depends on your abode.
No more light answers. Let our officers
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the queen
The death of Fulvia
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar
The empire of the sea: our slippery people
Till his deserts are past
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son; who
For the main soldier: whose quality
Our quick remove from hence.
I shall do't.
Exeunt
SCENE III. The same. Another room.
Enter CLEOPATRA
Where is he?
I did not see him since.
See where he is
I did not send you: if you find him sad
That I am sudden sick: quick
Exit ALEXAS
Madam
The like from him.
What should I do
In each thing give him way
Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.
Tempt him not so too far; I wish
In time we hate that which we often fear.
But here comes Antony.
Enter MARK ANTONY
I am sick and sullen.
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose
Help me away
It cannot be thus long
Will not sustain it.
Now
Pray you
What's the matter?
I know
What says the married woman? You may go:
Would she had never given you leave to come!
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
I have no power upon you; hers you are.
The gods best know
O
So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
I saw the treasons planted.
Cleopatra
Why should I think you can be mine and true
Most sweet queen
Nay
Eternity was in our lips and eyes
How now
I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
There were a heart in Egypt.
Hear me
The strong necessity of time commands
Our services awhile; but my full heart
Remains in use with you. Our Italy
Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
Equality of two domestic powers
Breed scrupulous faction: the hated
Upon the present state
And quietness
By any desperate change: my more particular
Though age from folly could not give me freedom
She's dead
Look here
The garboils she awaked; at the last
See when and where she died.
O most false love!
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water? Now I see
Quarrel no more
The purposes I bear; which are
That quickens Nilus' slime
Thy soldier
As thou affect'st.
Cut my lace
But let it be: I am quickly ill
My precious queen
And give true evidence to his love
An honourable trial.
So Fulvia told me.
I prithee
Belong to Egypt: good now
Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
Life perfect honour.
You'll heat my blood: no more.
You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
Now
And target. Still he mends;
But this is not the best. Look
The carriage of his chafe.
I'll leave you
Courteous lord
Sir
Sir
That you know well: something it is I would
But that your royalty
Holds idleness your subject
For idleness itself.
'Tis sweating labour
To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this. But
Since my becomings kill me
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
Be strew'd before your feet!
Let us go. Come;
Our separation so abides
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
You may see
Our great competitor: from Alexandria
This is the news: he fishes
The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like
Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience
Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
A man who is the abstract of all faults
That all men follow.
I must not think there are
Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
You are too indulgent. Let us grant
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
To reel the streets at noon
With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
becomes him
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemish
No way excuse his soils
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
His vacancy with his voluptuousness
As his own state and ours
As we rate boys
Enter a Messenger
Here's more news.
Thy biddings have been done; and every hour
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;
And it appears he is beloved of those
That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
The discontents repair
Give him much wrong'd.
I should have known no less.
It hath been taught us from the primal state
And the ebb'd man
Caesar
With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
They make in Italy; the borders maritime
Lack blood to think on't
No vessel can peep forth
Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
Than could his war resisted.
Antony
Wast beaten from Modena
Hirtius and Pansa
Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against
Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
The stale of horses
Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
Yea
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
Was borne so like a soldier
So much as lank'd not.
'Tis pity of him.
Let his shames quickly
Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
Thrives in our idleness.
To-morrow
Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time.
Till which encounter
Farewell
Of stirs abroad
Doubt not
I knew it for my bond.
Exeunt
SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
Enter CLEOPATRA

Madam?
Ha
Give me to drink mandragora.
Why
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away.
You think of him too much.
O
Madam
Thou
What's your highness' pleasure?
Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
Yes
Indeed!
Not in deed
But what indeed is honest to be done:
Yet have I fierce affections
What Venus did with Mars.
O Charmian
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
O happy horse
Do bravely
The demi-Atlas of this earth
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now
For so he calls me: now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
There would he anchor his aspect and die
With looking on his life.
Enter ALEXAS
Sovereign of Egypt
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet
With his tinct gilded thee.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
Last thing he did
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
Mine ear must pluck it thence.
'Good friend
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot
Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east
Was beastly dumb'd by him.
What
Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
Of hot and cold
O well-divided disposition! Note him
He was not sad
That make their looks by his; he was not merry
In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry
Ay
Why do you send so thick?
Who's born that day
When I forget to send to Antony
Welcome
O that brave Caesar!
Be choked with such another emphasis!
Say
The valiant Caesar!

Get me ink and paper:

If the great gods be just
The deeds of justest men.

Whiles we are suitors to their throne
The thing we sue for.
We
Deny us for our good; so find we profit
By losing of our prayers.
I shall do well:
The people love me
My powers are crescent
Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
In Egypt sits at dinner
No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both
Caesar and Lepidus
Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
Where have you this? 'tis false.
From Silvius
He dreams: I know they are in Rome together
Let witchcraft join with beauty
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
Enter VARRIUS
How now
This is most certain that I shall deliver:
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
A space for further travel.
I could have given less matter
A better ear. Menas
This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
For such a petty war: his soldiership
Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
The higher our opinion
Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
I cannot hope
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
His brother warr'd upon him; although
I know not
Were't not that we stand up against them all
themselves;
For they have entertained cause enough
To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
May cement their divisions and bind up
The petty difference
Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
Come

Good Enobarbus
To soft and gentle speech.
I shall entreat him
To answer like himself: if Caesar move him
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter
'Tis not a time
For private stomaching.
Every time
Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
But small to greater matters must give way.
Not if the small come first.
Your speech is passion:
But
The noble Antony.
Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
And yonder
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
If we compose well here
Hark
I do not know
Noble friends
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss
Our trivial difference loud
Murder in healing wounds: then
'Tis spoken well.
Were we before our armies
I should do thus.
Flourish
Welcome to Rome.
Thank you.
Sit.
Sit
Nay
I learn
I must be laugh'd at
Should say myself offended
Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at
Once name you derogately
It not concern'd me.
My being in Egypt
No more than my residing here at Rome
Might be to you in Egypt: yet
Did practise on my state
Might be my question.
How intend you
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
Made wars upon me; and their contestation
Was theme for you
You do mistake your business; my brother never
Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
And have my learning from some true reports
Discredit my authority with yours;
And make the wars alike against my stomach
Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel
You praise yourself
By laying defects of judgment to me; but
You patch'd up your excuses.
Not so
I know you could not lack
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife
The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
You may pace easy
Would we had all such wives
to wars with the women!
So much uncurbable
Made out of her impatience
Shrewdness of policy too
Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
But say
I wrote to you
When rioting in Alexandria; you
Did pocket up my letters
Did gibe my missive out of audience.
Sir
Three kings I had newly feasted
Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
I told him of myself; which was as much
As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend
You have broken
The article of your oath; which you shall never
Have tongue to charge me with.
Soft
No
The honour is sacred which he talks on now
The article of my oath.
To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
The which you both denied.
Neglected
And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may
Shall not make poor my greatness
Work without it. Truth is
For which myself
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
To stoop in such a case.
'Tis noble spoken.
If it might please you
The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
Were to remember that the present need
Speaks to atone you.
Worthily spoken
Or
instant
Pompey
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
Go to
I do not much dislike the matter
The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
We shall remain in friendship
So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
What hoop should hold us stanch
O' the world I would pursue it.
Give me leave
Speak
Thou hast a sister by the mother's side
Is now a widower.
Say not so
If Cleopatra heard you
Were well deserved of rashness.
I am not married
Agrippa further speak.
To hold you in perpetual amity
With an unslipping  knot
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
No worse a husband than the best of men;
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
That which none else can utter. By this marriage
Would
For 'tis a studied
Will Caesar speak?
Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
With what is spoke already.
What power is in Agrippa
To make this good?
The power of Caesar
His power unto Octavia.
May I never
To this good purpose
Further this act of grace: and from this hour
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
And sway our great designs!
There is my hand.
A sister I bequeath you
Did ever love so dearly: let her live
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
Fly off our loves again!
Happily
I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late upon me: I must thank him only
At heel of that
Time calls upon's:
Of us must Pompey presently be sought
Where lies he?
About the mount Misenum.
What is his strength by land?
Great and increasing: but by sea
He is an absolute master.
So is the fame.
Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
Yet
The business we have talk'd of.
With most gladness:
And do invite you to my sister's view
Let us
Noble Antony
Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Welcome from Egypt
Half the heart of Caesar
honourable friend
Good Enobarbus!
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
Ay
made the night light with drinking.
Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast
but twelve persons there; is this true?
This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
monstrous matter of feast
She's a most triumphant lady
her.
When she first met Mark Antony
his heart
There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised
well for her.
I will tell you.
The barge she sat in
Purple the sails
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver
The water which they beat to follow faster
In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
O
Her gentlewomen
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
Her people out upon her; and Antony
Rare Egyptian!
Upon her landing
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony
For what his eyes eat only.
Royal wench!
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
He plough'd her
I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street;
And having lost her breath
Now Antony must leave her utterly.
Never; he will not:
Age cannot wither her
Her infinite variety: other women cloy
The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish.
If beauty
The heart of Antony
A blessed lottery to him.
Let us go.
Good Enobarbus
Whilst you abide here.
Humbly
Exeunt
SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
Enter MARK ANTONY
The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom.
All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you.
Good night
I have not kept my square; but that to come
Shall all be done by the rule. Good night
Good night
Good night.
Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA
Enter Soothsayer
Now
Would I had never come from thence
If you can
I see it in
My motion
Hie you to Egypt again.
Say to me
Caesar's.
Therefore
Thy demon
Noble
Becomes a fear
Make space enough between you.
Speak this no more.
To none but thee; no more
If thou dost play with him at any game
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
But
Get thee gone:
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:
Exit Soothsayer
He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap
And in our sports my better cunning faints
Under his chance: if we draw lots
His cocks do win the battle still of mine
Beat mine
And though I make this marriage for my peace
Enter VENTIDIUS
O
Follow me
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The same. A street.
Enter LEPIDUS
Trouble yourselves no further: pray you
Your generals after.
Sir
Will e'en but kiss Octavia
Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress
We shall
Before you
Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about:
You'll win two days upon me.
Sir
Farewell.
Exeunt
SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
Enter CLEOPATRA
Give me some music; music
Of us that trade in love.
The music
Enter MARDIAN
Let it alone; let's to billiards: come
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
As with a woman. Come
As well as I can
And when good will is show'd
too short
Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there
Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws; and
'Twas merry when
You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
Did hang a salt-fish on his hook
With fervency drew up.
That time
I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn
Then put my tires and mantles on him
I wore his sword Philippan.
Enter a Messenger
O
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears
Madam
Antonius dead!--If thou say so
My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
Have lipp'd
First
Why
But
To say the dead are well: bring it to that
Down thy ill-uttering throat.
Good madam
Well
But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
Be free and healthful
To trumpet such good tidings! If not well
Will't please you hear me?
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
Yet if thou say Antony lives
Rich pearls upon thee.
Madam
Well said.
And friends with Caesar.
Thou'rt an honest man.
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
Make thee a fortune from me.
But yet
I do not like 'But yet
The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee
In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.
Free
He's bound unto Octavia.
For what good turn?
For the best turn i' the bed.
I am pale
Madam
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
Strikes him down
Good madam
What say you? Hence
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
She hales him up and down
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire
Gracious madam
Say 'tis not so
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg.
He's married
Rogue
Draws a knife
Nay
What mean you
Exit
Good madam
The man is innocent.
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
Though I am mad
He is afeard to come.
I will not hurt him.
Exit CHARMIAN
These hands do lack nobility
A meaner than myself; since I myself
Have given myself the cause.
Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger
Come hither
Though it be honest
To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
Themselves when they be felt.
I have done my duty.
Is he married?
I cannot hate thee worser than I do
He's married
The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
Should I lie
O
A cistern for scaled snakes! Go
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
I crave your highness' pardon.
He is married?
Take no offence that I would not offend you:
To punish me for what you make me do.
Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
O
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand
Exit Messenger
Good your highness
In praising Antony
Many times
I am paid for't now.
Lead me from hence:
I faint: O Iras
Go to the fellow
Report the feature of Octavia
The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
Exit ALEXAS
Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian
To MARDIAN
Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Near Misenum.
Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door
Your hostages I have
And we shall talk before we fight.
Most meet
That first we come to words; and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent;
Which
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword
That else must perish here.
To you all three
Wherefore my father should revengers want
That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what
Made the all-honour'd
Have one man but a man? And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
Cast on my noble father.
Take your time.
Thou canst not fear us
We'll speak with thee at sea: at land
How much we do o'er-count thee.
At land
But
Be pleased to tell us--
For this is from the present--how you take
The offers we have sent you.
There's the point.
Which do not be entreated to
What it is worth embraced.
And what may follow
You have made me offer
Of Sicily
Rid all the sea of pirates; then
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
To part with unhack'd edges
Our targes undinted.
That's our offer.
Know
To take this offer: but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience: though I lose
The praise of it by telling
Her welcome friendly.
I have heard it
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you.
Let me have your hand:
I did not think
The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you
For I have gain'd by 't.
Since I saw you last
Well
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
But in my bosom shall she never come
Well met here.
I hope so
I crave our composition may be written
That's the next to do.
We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
Draw lots who shall begin.
That will I
No
Or last
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there.
You have heard much.
I have fair meanings
And fair words to them.
Then so much have I heard:
And I have heard
No more of that: he did so.
What
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
I know thee now: how farest thou
Well;
And well am like to do; for
Let me shake thy hand;
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight
Sir
As I have said you did.
Enjoy thy plainness
Aboard my galley I invite you all:
Will you lead
Show us the way
Come.
Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
[Aside]  Thy father
made this treaty.--You and I have known
At sea
We have
You have done well by water.
And you by land.
I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land.
Nor what I have done by water.
Yes
safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
And you by land.
There I deny my land service. But give me your
hand
might take two thieves kissing.
All men's faces are true
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
No slander; they steal hearts.
We came hither to fight with you.
For my part
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
If he do
You've said
here: pray you
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
TRUE
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
Pray ye
'Tis true.
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
If I were bound to divine of this unity
not prophesy so.
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
marriage than the love of the parties.
I think so too. But you shall find
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
holy
Who would not have his wife so?
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and
I said before
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
he married but his occasion here.
And thus it may be. Come
I have a health for you.
I shall take it
Come
Exeunt
SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley
Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet
Here they'll be
ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
will blow them down.
Lepidus is high-coloured.
They have made him drink alms-drink.
As they pinch one another by the disposition
cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
entreaty
But it raises the greater war between him and
his discretion.
Why
fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
To be called into a huge sphere
to move in't
A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they
the flow o' the Nile
By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain
You've strange serpents there.
Ay
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
They are so.
Sit
I am not so well as I should be
Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.
Nay
pyramises are very goodly things; without
contradiction
[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey
[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear:
what is't?
[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat
thee
[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.
This wine for Lepidus!
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
It is shaped
as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is
which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
it
What colour is it of?
Of it own colour too.
'Tis a strange serpent.
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
Will this description satisfy him?
With the health that Pompey gives him
very epicure.
[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang
that? away!
Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thou
wilt hear me
[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.
The matter?
Rises
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
Be jolly
These quick-sands
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
What say'st thou?
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
How should that be?
But entertain it
Will give thee all the world.
Hast thou drunk well?
Now
Thou art
Whate'er the ocean pales
Show me which way.
These three world-sharers
And
All there is thine.
Ah
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know
Mine honour
Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown
But must condemn it now. Desist
[Aside]  For this
Who seeks
This health to Lepidus!
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him
Here's to thee
Enobarbus
Fill till the cup be hid.
There's a strong fellow
Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS
Why?
A' bears the third part of the world
not?
The third part
Drink thou; increase the reels.
Come.
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels
Here is to Caesar!
I could well forbear't.
It's monstrous labour
Be a child o' the time.
Possess it
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one.
Ha
To MARK ANTONY
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
Let's ha't
Come
In soft and delicate Lethe.
All take hands.
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley.
Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
THE SONG.
Come
In thy fats our cares be drown'd
Cup us
What would you more? Pompey
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
Good Antony
I'll try you on the shore.
And shall
O Antony
Come
Take heed you fall not.
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS
Menas
No
These drums! these trumpets
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd
Sound a flourish
Ho! says a' There's my cap.
Ho! Noble captain
Exeunt
ACT III
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.
Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph
Now
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus
Noble Ventidius
The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.
O Silius
Better to leave undone
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person: Sossius
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition
I could do more to do Antonius good
Should my performance perish.
Thou hast
Without the which a soldier
I'll humbly signify what in his name
How
We have jaded out o' the field.
Where is he now?
He purposeth to Athens: whither
The weight we must convey with's will permit
Exeunt
SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
Enter AGRIPPA at one door
What
They have dispatch'd with Pompey
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus
With the green sickness.
'Tis a noble Lepidus.
A very fine one: O
Nay
Caesar? Why
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
Would you praise Caesar
Indeed
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
Ho! hearts
Think
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar
Both he loves.
They are his shards
Trumpets within
So;
This is to horse. Adieu
Good fortune
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
No further
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in 't. Sister
As my thoughts make thee
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony
Betwixt us as the cement of our love
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have loved without this mean
This be not cherish'd.
Make me not offended
In your distrust.
I have said.
You shall not find
For what you seem to fear: so
We will here part.
Farewell
The elements be kind to thee
Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.
My noble brother!
The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring
Sir
What
I'll tell you in your ear.
Her tongue will not obey her heart
Her heart inform her tongue
down-feather
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  Will Caesar weep?
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  He has a cloud in 's face.
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  He were the worse for that
So is he
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  Why
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
[Aside to AGRIPPA]  That year
troubled with a rheum;
What willingly he did confound he wail'd
No
Out-go my thinking on you.
Come
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look
Adieu; be happy!
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!
Farewell
Kisses OCTAVIA
Farewell!
Trumpets sound. Exeunt
SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
Enter CLEOPATRA
Where is the fellow?
Half afeard to come.
Go to
Enter the Messenger as before
Come hither
Good majesty
But when you are well pleased.
That Herod's head
I'll have: but how
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
Most gracious majesty
Didst thou behold Octavia?
Ay
Where?
Madam
I look'd her in the face
Between her brother and Mark Antony.
Is she as tall as me?
She is not
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?
Madam
That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
I think so
What majesty is in her gait? Remember
She creeps:
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life
Is this certain?
Or I have no observance.
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
The fellow has good judgment.
Excellent.
Guess at her years
Madam
Widow! Charmian
And I do think she's thirty.
Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
Round even to faultiness.
For the most part
Her hair
Brown
As low as she would wish it.
There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepared.
Exit Messenger
A proper man.
Indeed
That so I harried him. Why
Nothing
The man hath seen some majesty
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend
I have one thing more to ask him yet
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.
I warrant you
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.
Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA
Nay
That were excusable
Of semblable import
New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will
To public ear:
Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honour
He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
When the best hint was given him
O my good lord
The good gods me presently
Undo that prayer
'Twixt these extremes at all.
Gentle Octavia
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour
Than yours so branchless. But
Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
So your desires are yours.
Thanks to my lord.
The Jove of power make me most weak
As if the world should cleave
Should solder up the rift.
When it appears to you where this begins
Can never be so equal
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
Choose your own company
Your heart has mind to.
Exeunt
SCENE V. The same. Another room.
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS
How now
There's strange news come
What
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
This is old: what is the success?
Caesar
Pompey
him partake in the glory of the action: and not
resting here
wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal
the poor third is up
Then
And throw between them all the food thou hast
He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murder'd Pompey.
Our great navy's rigg'd.
For Italy and Caesar. More
My lord desires you presently: my news
I might have told hereafter.
'Twill be naught:
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
Come
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Contemning Rome
I' the market-place
Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
Caesarion
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
Of lower Syria
This in the public eye?
I' the common show-place
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
Great Media
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
Syria
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience
Let Rome be thus Inform'd.
Who
Already
The people know it; and have now received
His accusations.
Who does he accuse?
Caesar: and that
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd
His part o' the isle: then does he say
Some shipping unrestored: lastly
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be deposed; and
All his revenue.
Sir
'Tis done already
I have told him
That he his high authority abused
Demand the like.
He'll never yield to that.
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
Enter OCTAVIA with her train
Hail
That ever I should call thee castaway!
You have not call'd me so
Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
The ostentation of our love
By sea and land; supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.
Good my lord
On my free will. My lord
My grieved ear withal; whereon
His pardon for return.
Which soon he granted
Do not say so
I have eyes upon him
Where is he now?
My lord
No
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
Up to a whore; who now are levying
The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
Bocchus
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king
King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas
Ay me
That do afflict each other!
Welcome hither:
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
Till we perceived
Be you not troubled with the time
O'er your content these strong necessities;
But let determined things to destiny
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
And ever welcome to us.
Welcome
Welcome
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
Only the adulterous Antony
In his abominations
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
Is it so
Most certain. Sister
Exeunt
SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.
Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
I will be even with thee
But why
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars
Well
If not denounced against us
Be there in person?
[Aside]  Well
If we should serve with horse and mares together
A soldier and his horse.
What is't you say?
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
Take from his heart
Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
Manage this war.
Sink Rome
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
I will not stay behind.
Nay
Here comes the emperor.
Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS
Is it not strange
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea
Celerity is never more admired
Than by the negligent.
A good rebuke
Will fight with him by sea.
By sea! what else?
Why will my lord do so?
For that he dares us to't.
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
Ay
Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers
And so should you.
Your ships are not well mann'd;
Your mariners are muleters
Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
Their ships are yare; yours
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea
By sea
Most worthy sir
The absolute soldiership you have by land;
Distract your army
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
The way which promises assurance; and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
I'll fight at sea.
I have sixty sails
Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
And
Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail
Enter a Messenger
Thy business?
The news is true
Caesar has taken Toryne.
Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
Strange that power should be. Canidius
Away
Enter a Soldier
How now
O noble emperor
Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
Have used to conquer
Well
Exeunt MARK ANTONY
By Hercules
Soldier
Not in the power on't: so our leader's led
You keep by land
The legions and the horse whole
Marcus Octavius
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
Carries beyond belief.
While he was yet in Rome
Beguiled all spies.
Who's his lieutenant
They say
Well I know the man.
Enter a Messenger
The emperor calls Canidius.
With news the time's with labour
Exeunt
SCENE VIII. A plain near Actium.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Taurus!
My lord?
Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle
The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies
Upon this jump.
Exeunt
SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.
Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill
We may the number of the ships behold
Exeunt
SCENE X. Another part of the plain.
CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over  the stage; and TAURUS
Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Naught
The Antoniad
To see't mine eyes are blasted.
Enter SCARUS
Gods and goddesses
What's thy passion!
The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
Kingdoms and provinces.
How appears the fight?
On our side like the token'd pestilence
Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight
That I beheld:
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight
Endure a further view.
She once being loof'd
I never saw an action of such shame;
Experience
Did violate so itself.
Alack
Enter CANIDIUS
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath
Been what he knew himself
O
Ay
Why
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
What further comes.
To Caesar will I render
My legions and my horse: six kings already
Show me the way of yielding.
I'll yet follow
The wounded chance of Antony
Sits in the wind against me.
Exeunt
SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants
Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
It is ashamed to bear me! Friends
I am so lated in the world
Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
Laden with gold; take that
Fly! not we.
I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
To run and show their shoulders. Friends
I have myself resolved upon a course
Which has no need of you; be gone:
My treasure's in the harbour
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness
For fear and doting. Friends
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you. Pray you
Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Leave me
Nay
Sits down
Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following
Nay
Do
Do! why: what else?
Let me sit down. O Juno!
No
See you here
O fie
Madam!
Madam
Sir
Yes
His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck
The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
Dealt on lieutenantry
In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.
Ah
The queen
Go to him
He is unqualitied with very shame.
Well then
Most noble sir
Her head's declined
Your comfort makes the rescue.
I have offended reputation
Sir
O
By looking back what I have left behind
'Stroy'd in dishonour.
O my lord
You would have follow'd.
Egypt
My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings
Thy full supremacy thou knew'st
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
Command me.
O
Now I must
To the young man send humble treaties
And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased
How much you were my conqueror; and that
My sword
Obey it on all cause.
Pardon
Fall not a tear
All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
Is he come back? Love
Some wine
We scorn her most when most she offers blows.
Exeunt
SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Let him appear that's come from Antony.
Know you him?
Caesar
An argument that he is pluck'd
He sends so poor a pinion off his wing
Not many moons gone by.
Enter EUPHRONIUS
Approach
Such as I am
I was of late as petty to his ends
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
To his grand sea.
Be't so: declare thine office.
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee
Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth
Next
Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs
For Antony
Of audience nor desire shall fail
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend
Fortune pursue thee!
Bring him through the bands.
Exit EUPHRONIUS
To THYREUS
From Antony win Cleopatra: promise
In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning
Make thine own edict for thy pains
Will answer as a law.
Caesar
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw
In every power that moves.
Caesar
Exeunt
SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
Enter CLEOPATRA
What shall we do
Think
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
Antony only
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war
Frighted each other? why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point
The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
Than was his loss
Prithee
Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS
Is that his answer?
Ay
The queen shall then have courtesy
Will yield us up.
He says so.
Let her know't.
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head
With principalities.
That head
To him again: tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
Something particular: his coin
Under the service of a child as soon
As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
To lay his gay comparisons apart
Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
[Aside]  Yes
Unstate his happiness
A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
Do draw the inward quality after them
Answer his emptiness! Caesar
His judgment too.
Enter an Attendant
A messenger from CAESAR.
What
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him
Exit Attendant
[Aside]  Mine honesty and I begin to square.
The loyalty well held to fools does make
Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
Does conquer him that did his master conquer
And earns a place i' the story.
Enter THYREUS
Caesar's will?
Hear it apart.
None but friends: say boldly.
So
He needs as many
Or needs not us. If Caesar please
Will leap to be his friend: for us
So.
Thus then
Go on: right royal.
He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love
O!
The scars upon your honour
Does pity
He is a god
What is most right: mine honour was not yielded
[Aside]             To be sure of that
Thy dearest quit thee.
Exit
Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him? for he partly begs
To be desired to give. It much would please him
To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits
What's your name?
My name is Thyreus.
Most kind messenger
I kiss his conquering hand: tell him
To lay my crown at 's feet
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt.
'Tis your noblest course.
Wisdom and fortune combating together
My duty on your hand.
Your Caesar's father oft
Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Favours
What art thou
One that but performs
The bidding of the fullest man
To have command obey'd.
[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.
Approach
and devils!
Authority melts from me: of late
Like boys unto a muss
Antony yet.
Enter Attendants
Take hence this Jack
[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
Than with an old one dying.
Moon and stars!
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
That do acknowledge Caesar
So saucy with the hand of she here
Mark Antony!
Tug him away: being whipp'd
Bear us an errand to him.
Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS
You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome
By one that looks on feeders?
Good my lord
You have been a boggler ever:
But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;
In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
Adore our errors; laugh at's
To our confusion.
O
I found you as a morsel cold upon
Dead Caesar's trencher; nay
Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours
Luxuriously pick'd out: for
Wherefore is this?
To let a fellow that will take rewards
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
My playfellow
And plighter of high hearts! O
Upon the hill of Basan
The horned herd! for I have savage cause;
And to proclaim it civilly
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
For being yare about him.
Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS
Is he whipp'd?
Soundly
Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
He did ask favour.
If that thy father live
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
To follow Caesar in his triumph
Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
The white hand of a lady fever thee
He makes me angry with him; for he seems
Proud and disdainful
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
My speech and what is done
Hipparchus
He may at pleasure whip
Hence with thy stripes
Exit THYREUS
Have you done yet?
Alack
Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
The fall of Antony!
I must stay his time.
To flatter Caesar
With one that ties his points?
Not know me yet?
Cold-hearted toward me?
Ah
Drop in my neck: as it determines
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
Till by degrees the memory of my womb
Have buried them for prey!
I am satisfied.
Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
Have knit again
Where hast thou been
If from the field I shall return once more
To kiss these lips
I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
There's hope in't yet.
That's my brave lord!
I will be treble-sinew'd
Were nice and lucky
Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
Let's mock the midnight bell.
It is my birth-day:
I had thought to have held it poor: but
Is Antony again
We will yet do well.
Call all his noble captains to my lord.
Do so
The wine peep through their scars. Come on
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight
Even with his pestilent scythe.
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason
Some way to leave him.
Exit
ACT IV
SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
He calls me boy; and chides
To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat
I have many other ways to die; meantime
Laugh at his challenge.
Caesar must think
Even to falling. Give him no breath
Make boot of his distraction: never anger
Made good guard for itself.
Let our best heads
Know
We mean to fight: within our files there are
And feast the army; we have store to do't
Exeunt
SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
Enter MARK ANTONY
He will not fight with me
No.
Why should he not?
He thinks
To-morrow
Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
I'll strike
Well said; come on.
Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
Be bounteous at our meal.
Enter three or four Servitors
Give me thy hand
Thou
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What means this?
[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  'Tis one of those odd
tricks which sorrow shoots
Out of the mind.
And thou art honest too.
I wish I could be made so many men
An Antony
So good as you have done.
The gods forbid!
Well
Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
As when mine empire was your fellow too
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What does he mean?
[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  To make his followers weep.
Tend me to-night;
May be it is the period of your duty:
Haply you shall not see me more; or if
You'll serve another master. I look on you
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends
Married to your good service
Tend me to-night two hours
What mean you
And I
Ho
Now the witch take me
Grace grow where those drops fall!
My hearty friends
For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
To burn this night with torches: know
Where rather I'll expect victorious life
Than death and honour. Let's to supper
Exeunt
SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.
Enter two Soldiers to their guard
Brother
It will determine one way: fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
Nothing. What news?
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
Well
Enter two other Soldiers
Soldiers
And you. Good night
They place themselves in every corner of the stage
Here we: and if to-morrow
Our navy thrive
Our landmen will stand up.
'Tis a brave army
Music of the hautboys as under the stage
Peace! what noise?
List
Hark!
Music i' the air.
Under the earth.
It signs well
No.
Peace
What should this mean?
'Tis the god Hercules
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do?
They advance to another post
How now
[Speaking together]  How now!
How now! do you hear this?
Ay; is't not strange?
Do you hear
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.
Content. 'Tis strange.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.
Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA
Eros! mine armour
Sleep a little.
No
Enter EROS with armour
Come good fellow
If fortune be not ours to-day
Because we brave her: come.
Nay
What's this for?
Ah
The armourer of my heart: false
Sooth
Well
We shall thrive now. Seest thou
Go put on thy defences.
Briefly
Is not this buckled well?
Rarely
He that unbuckles this
To daff't for our repose
Thou fumblest
More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love
The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
A workman in't.
Enter an armed Soldier
Good morrow to thee; welcome:
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
To business that we love we rise betime
A thousand
Shout. Trumpets flourish
Enter Captains and Soldiers
The morn is fair. Good morrow
Good morrow
'Tis well blown
This morning
That means to be of note
So
Fare thee well
This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable
Kisses her
And worthy shameful cheque it were
On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
Now
Exeunt MARK ANTONY
Please you
Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight!
Then Antony
Exeunt
SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.
Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
To make me fight at land!
Hadst thou done so
That has this morning left thee
Follow'd thy heels.
Who's gone this morning?
Who!
One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus
Say 'I am none of thine.'
What say'st thou?
Sir
Sir
He has not with him.
Is he gone?
Most certain.
Go
Detain no jot
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. O
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
Flourish. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Go forth
Our will is Antony be took alive;
Make it so known.
Caesar
Exit
The time of universal peace is near:
Prove this a prosperous day
Shall bear the olive freely.
Enter a Messenger
Antony
Is come into the field.
Go charge Agrippa
Plant those that have revolted in the van
Upon himself.
Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
That fell away have entertainment
No honourable trust. I have done ill;
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's
Enobarbus
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure
His bounty overplus: the messenger
Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
Unloading of his mules.
I give it you.
Mock not
I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
Out of the host; I must attend mine office
Continues still a Jove.
Exit
I am alone the villain of the earth
My better service
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
If swift thought break it not
Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't
I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
My latter part of life.
Exit
SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.
Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others
Retire
Caesar himself has work
Exceeds what we expected.
Exeunt
Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded
O my brave emperor
Had we done so at first
With clouts about their heads.
Thou bleed'st apace.
I had a wound here that was like a T
They do retire.
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
Room for six scotches more.
Enter EROS
They are beaten
For a fair victory.
Let us score their backs
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
I will reward thee
Once for thy spritely comfort
For thy good valour. Come thee on.
I'll halt after.
Exeunt
SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria.
Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY
We have beat him to his camp: run one before
That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
For doughty-handed are you
Not as you served the cause
Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
Enter the city
Wash the congealment from your wounds
The honour'd gashes whole.
To SCARUS
Give me thy hand
Enter CLEOPATRA
To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts
To CLEOPATRA
O thou day o' the world
Ride on the pants triumphing!
Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue
The world's great snare uncaught?
My nightingale
though grey
Do something mingle with our younger brown
A brain that nourishes our nerves
Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
Kiss it
As if a god
Destroy'd in such a shape.
I'll give thee
He has deserved it
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
Had our great palace the capacity
To camp this host
Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together
Exeunt
SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
Sentinels at their post
If we be not relieved within this hour
Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
By the second hour i' the morn.
This last day was
A shrewd one to's.
Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
O
What man is this?
Stand close
Be witness to me
Bear hateful memory
Before thy face repent!
Enobarbus!
Peace!
Hark further.
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy
Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
Which
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive:
O Antony! O Antony!
Dies
Let's speak To him.
Let's hear him
May concern Caesar.
Let's do so. But he sleeps.
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep.
Go we to him.
Awake
Hear you
The hand of death hath raught him.
Drums afar off
Hark! the drums
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
Is fully out.
Come on
He may recover yet.
Exeunt with the body
SCENE X. Between the two camps.
Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS
Their preparation is to-day by sea;
We please them not by land.
For both
I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;
We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;
They have put forth the haven
Where their appointment we may best discover
Exeunt
SCENE XI. Another part of the same.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
But being charged
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales
Exeunt
SCENE XII. Another part of the same.
Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS
Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine
does stand
Straight
Exit
Swallows have built
In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
Say they know not
Is valiant
Alarum afar off
Re-enter MARK ANTONY
All is lost;
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:
My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
'tis thou
Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
For when I am revenged upon my charm
Exit SCARUS
O sun
Fortune and Antony part here; even here
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
That spaniel'd me at heels
Their wishes
On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm
Whose eye beck'd forth my wars
Whose bosom was my crownet
Like a right gipsy
What
Enter CLEOPATRA
Ah
Why is my lord enraged against his love?
Vanish
Follow his chariot
Of all thy sex; most monster-like
For poor'st diminutives
Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
With her prepared nails.
Exit CLEOPATRA
'Tis well thou'rt gone
Thou fell'st into my fury
Might have prevented many. Eros
The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
And with those hands
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me
Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros
Exit
SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace.
Enter CLEOPATRA
Help me
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
Was never so emboss'd.
To the monument!
There lock yourself
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.
To the monument!

Say
And word it
To the monument!
Exeunt
SCENE XIV. The same. Another room.
Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS
Eros
Ay
Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion
With trees upon't
these signs;
They are black vesper's pageants.
Ay
The rack dislimns
It does
My good knave Eros
Even such a body: here I am Antony:
Yet cannot hold this visible shape
I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen
Whose heart I thought I had
Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
A million more
Pack'd cards with Caesar
Unto an enemy's triumph.
Nay
Ourselves to end ourselves.
Enter MARDIAN
O! thy vile lady!
She has robb'd me of my sword.
No
My mistress loved thee
With thine entirely.
Hence
She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
Death of one person can be paid but once
Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
The name of Antony; it was divided
Between her heart and lips: she render'd life
Dead
Dead.
Unarm
To MARDIAN
That thou depart'st hence safe
Exit MARDIAN
Off
The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart. O
Heart
No more a soldier: bruised pieces
You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
Exit EROS
I will o'ertake thee
Weep for my pardon. So it must be
All length is torture: since the torch is out
Mars what it does; yea
Itself with strength: seal then
Eros!--I come
Where souls do couch on flowers
Dido and her AEneas shall want troops
Re-enter EROS
What would my lord?
Since Cleopatra died
Detest my baseness. I
Quarter'd the world
With ships made cities
The courage of a woman; less noble mind
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn
Is come indeed
The inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace and horror
Thou strikest not me
Put colour in thy cheek.
The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts
Eros
Thy master thus with pleach'd arms
His corrigible neck
To penetrative shame
Of fortunate Caesar
His baseness that ensued?
I would not see't.
Come
Draw that thy honest sword
Most useful for thy country.
O
When I did make thee free
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurposed. Draw
Turn from me
Lo thee!
Turning from him
My sword is drawn.
Then let it do at once
The thing why thou hast drawn it.
My dear master
'Tis said
Farewell
Now
Why
Of Antony's death.
Kills himself
Thrice-nobler than myself!
Thou teachest me
I should
Have by their brave instruction got upon me
A nobleness in record: but I will be
A bridegroom in my death
As to a lover's bed. Come
Falling on his sword
I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
The guard
Enter DERCETAS and Guard
What's the noise?
I have done my work in
Of what I have begun.
The star is fall'n.
And time is at his period.
Alas
Let him that loves me strike me dead.
Not I.
Nor I.
Nor any one.
Exeunt Guard
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
This sword but shown to Caesar
Enter DIOMEDES
Where's Antony?
There
Lives he?
Wilt thou not answer
Exit DERCETAS
Art thou there
Sufficing strokes for death.
Most absolute lord
When did she send thee?
Now
Where is she?
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
Which never shall be found--you did suspect
She had disposed with Caesar
Would not be purged
But
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come
Too late
What
Come
Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY
Bear me
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
Woe
All your true followers out.
Most heavy day!
Nay
To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
Which comes to punish us
Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:
I have led you oft: carry me now
Exeunt
SCENE XV. The same. A monument.
Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft
O Charmian
Be comforted
No
All strange and terrible events are welcome
As that which makes it.
Enter
How now! is he dead?
His death's upon him
Look out o' the other side your monument;
His guard have brought him thither.
Enter
O sun
darkling stand
The varying shore o' the world. O Antony
Help
Peace!
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony
So it should be
Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
I am dying
I here importune death awhile
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay up thy lips.
I dare not
Dear my lord
Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
Be brooch'd with me; if knife
Edge
Your wife Octavia
And still conclusion
Demuring upon me. But come
Help me
Assist
O
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
Our strength is all gone into heaviness
Wishes were ever fools
They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA
And welcome
Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power
A heavy sight!
I am dying
Give me some wine
No
One word
Of Caesar seek your honour
They do not go together.
Gentle
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
None about Caesar.
The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
Wherein I lived
My countryman
Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
I can no more.
Noblest of men
Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
In this dull world
No better than a sty? O
The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
O
Are level now with men; the odds is gone
Beneath the visiting moon.
Faints
O
She is dead too
Lady!
Madam!
O madam
Royal Egypt
Peace
No more
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
Patience is scottish
Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
To rush into the secret house of death
What
My noble girls! Ah
We'll bury him; and then
This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
Ah
But resolution
Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body
ACT V
SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Go to him
Being so frustrate
The pauses that he makes.
Caesar
Exit
Enter DERCETAS
Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
Appear thus to us?
I am call'd Dercetas;
Mark Antony I served
Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke
To spend upon his haters. If thou please
To take me to thee
I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not
What is't thou say'st?
I say
The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack: the round world
Should have shook lions into civil streets
Is not a single doom; in the name lay
A moiety of the world.
He is dead
Not by a public minister of justice
I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
With his most noble blood.
Look you sad
The gods rebuke me
To wash the eyes of kings.
And strange it is
Our most persisted deeds.
His taints and honours
Waged equal with him.
A rarer spirit never
Did steer humanity: but you
Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
When such a spacious mirror's set before him
O Antony!
I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
Have shown to thee such a declining day
In the whole world: but yet let me lament
In top of all design
Where mine his thoughts did kindle
Our equalness to this. Hear me
But I will tell you at some meeter season:
Enter an Egyptian
The business of this man looks out of him;
We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress
To the way she's forced to.
Bid her have good heart:
She soon shall know of us
Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
To be ungentle.
So the gods preserve thee!
Exit
Come hither
The quality of her passion shall require
She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
Would be eternal in our triumph: go
Caesar
Exit
Gallus
Exit GALLUS
Where's Dolabella
Dolabella!
Let him alone
How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
Go with me to my tent; where you shall see
How hardly I was drawn into this war;
How calm and gentle I proceeded still
In all my writings: go with me
What I can show in this.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.
Enter CLEOPATRA
My desolation does begin to make
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
Not being Fortune
To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
Which sleeps
Enter
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;
And bids thee study on what fair demands
Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
What's thy name?
My name is Proculeius.
Antony
Did tell me of you
I do not greatly care to be deceived
Would have a queen his beggar
No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son
Will kneel to him with thanks.
Be of good cheer;
You're fall'n into a princely hand
Make your full reference freely to my lord
On all that need: let me report to him
Your sweet dependency; and you shall find
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
Pray you
I am his fortune's vassal
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly
Look him i' the face.
This I'll report
Have comfort
Of him that caused it.
You see how easily she may be surprised:
Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the  monument by a ladder placed against a window
To PROCULEIUS and the Guard
Guard her till Caesar come.
Exit
Royal queen!
O Cleopatra! thou art taken
Quick
Drawing a dagger
Hold
Seizes and disarms her
Do not yourself such wrong
Relieved
What
Cleopatra
The undoing of yourself: let the world see
His nobleness well acted
Will never let come forth.
Where art thou
Come hither
Worthy many babes and beggars!
O
Sir
If idle talk will once be necessary
Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
And show me to the shouting varletry
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
Lay me stark naked
Blow me into abhorring! rather make
My country's high pyramides my gibbet
You do extend
These thoughts of horror further than you shall
Find cause in Caesar.
Enter DOLABELLA
Proculeius
So
To CLEOPATRA
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please
Say
Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers
Most noble empress
I cannot tell.
Assuredly you know me.
No matter
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
Is't not your trick?
I understand not
I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
O
But such another man!
If it might please ye
His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
A sun and moon
The little O
Most sovereign creature
His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
Crested the world: his voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb
That grew the more by reaping: his delights
Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
The element they lived in: in his livery
Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
Cleopatra!
Think you there was
As this I dream'd of?
Gentle madam
You lie
But
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet
And Antony
Hear me
Your loss is as yourself
As answering to the weight: would I might never
O'ertake pursued success
My very heart at root.
I thank you
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
Nay
Though he be honourable
He'll lead me
Madam
Flourish
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR
Which is the Queen of Egypt?
It is the emperor
CLEOPATRA kneels
Arise
I pray you
Sir
Will have it thus; my master and my lord
I must obey.
Take to you no hard thoughts:
The record of what injuries you did us
As things but done by chance.
Sole sir o' the world
To make it clear; but do confess I have
Been laden with like frailties which before
Have often shamed our sex.
Cleopatra
If you apply yourself to our intents
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
To lay on me a cruelty
Antony's course
Of my good purposes
To that destruction which I'll guard them from
And may
Hang in what place you please. Here
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
This is the brief of money
Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
Here
This is my treasurer: let him speak
To myself nothing. Speak the truth
Madam
What have I kept back?
Enough to purchase what you have made known.
Nay
Your wisdom in the deed.
See
And
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
Even make me wild: O slave
Than love that's hired! What
Go back
O rarely base!
Good queen
O Caesar
To one so meek
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy! Say
As we greet modern friends withal; and say
For Livia and Octavia
Their mediation; must I be unfolded
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
Beneath the fall I have.
To SELEUCUS
Prithee
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man
Forbear
Exit SELEUCUS
Be it known
For things that others do; and
Cleopatra
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed
Our care and pity is so much upon you
My master
Not so. Adieu.
Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train
He words me
Be noble to myself: but
Whispers CHARMIAN
Finish
Hie thee again:
I have spoke already
Go put it to the haste.
Madam
Re-enter DOLABELLA
Where is the queen?
Behold
Exit
Dolabella!
Madam
Intends his journey; and within three days
You with your children will he send before:
Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
Your pleasure and my promise.
Dolabella
I your servant
Farewell
Exit DOLABELLA
Now
Thou
In Rome
With greasy aprons
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths
The gods forbid!
Nay
Will catch at us
Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
Extemporally will stage us
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
I' the posture of a whore.
O the good gods!
Nay
I'll never see 't; for
Are stronger than mine eyes.
Why
To fool their preparation
Their most absurd intents.
Re-enter CHARMIAN
Now
Show me
My best attires: I am again for Cydnus
Now
And
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
Wherefore's this noise?
Exit IRAS. A noise within
Enter a Guardsman
Here is a rural fellow
That will not be denied your highness presence:
He brings you figs.
Let him come in.
Exit Guardsman
What poor an instrument
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
My resolution's placed
Of woman in me: now from head to foot
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
No planet is of mine.
Re-enter Guardsman
This is the man.
Avoid
Exit Guardsman
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
Truly
that should desire you to touch him
is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
never recover.
Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
Very many
them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman
do
biting of it
a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
believe all that they say
half that they do: but this is most fallible
worm's an odd worm.
Get thee hence; farewell.
I wish you all joy of the worm.
Setting down his basket
Farewell.
You must think this
do his kind.
Ay
Look you
keeping of wise people; for
goodness in worm.
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
Very good. Give it nothing
not worth the feeding.
Will it eat me?
You must not think I am so simple but I know the
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
woman is a dish for the gods
not. But
gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
that they make
Well
Yes
Exit
Re-enter IRAS with a robe
Give me my robe
Immortal longings in me: now no more
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
Yare
Antony call; I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
The luck of Caesar
To excuse their after wrath: husband
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
I am fire and air; my other elements
I give to baser life. So; have you done?
Come then
Farewell
Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
If thou and nature can so gently part
If thus thou vanishest
It is not worth leave-taking.
Dissolve
This proves me base:
If she first meet the curled Antony
Which is my heaven to have. Come
mortal wretch
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
Be angry
Unpolicied!
O eastern star!
Peace
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
O
As sweet as balm
O Antony!--Nay
Applying another asp to her arm
What should I stay--
Dies
In this vile world? So
Now boast thee
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
I'll mend it
Enter the Guard
Where is the queen?
Speak softly
Caesar hath sent--
Too slow a messenger.
Applies an asp
O
Approach
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
What work is here! Charmian
It is well done
Descended of so many royal kings.
Ah
Dies
Re-enter DOLABELLA
How goes it here?
All dead.
Caesar
Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
So sought'st to hinder.
Within  'A way there
Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching
O sir
That you did fear is done.
Bravest at the last
I do not see them bleed.
Who was last with them?
A simple countryman
This was his basket.
Poison'd
O Caesar
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
And on the sudden dropp'd.
O noble weakness!
If they had swallow'd poison
By external swelling: but she looks like sleep
In her strong toil of grace.
Here
The like is on her arm.
This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
Have slime upon them
Upon the caves of Nile.
Most probable
That so she died; for her physician tells me
She hath pursued conclusions infinite
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
And bear her women from the monument:
She shall be buried by her Antony:
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous. High events as these
Strike those that make them; and their story is
No less in pity than his glory which
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
In solemn show attend this funeral;
And then to Rome. Come
High order in this great solemnity.
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.
Enter DUKE SOLINUS
Proceed
And by the doom of death end woes and all.
Merchant of Syracuse
I am not partial to infringe our laws:
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
To merchants
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods
For
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
Again: if any Syracusian born
Come to the bay of Ephesus
Thy substance
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done
Well
Why thou departed'st from thy native home
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
Yet
Was wrought by nature
In Syracusa was I born
Unto a woman
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself
The pleasing punishment that women bear
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
And
That very hour
Of such a burden
Those
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
But longer did we not retain much hope;
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Which though myself would gladly have embraced
And this it was
The sailors sought for safety by our boat
My wife
To him one of the other twins was bound
The children thus disposed
And floating straight
At length the sun
And by the benefit of his wished light
Two ships from far making amain to us
But ere they came
Gather the sequel by that went before.
Nay
For we may pity
O
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
For
Which being violently borne upon
So that
What to delight in
Her part
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth
At length
And
And would have reft the fishers of their prey
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
My youngest boy
After his brother: and importuned me
That his attendant--so his case was like
Might bear him company in the quest of him:
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece
Hopeless to find
Or that or any place that harbours men.
But here must end the story of my life;
And happy were I in my timely death
Hapless AEgeon
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
Now
But
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
But to our honour's great disparagement
Therefore
To seek thy life by beneficial help:
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;

Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here;
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town
There is your money that I had to keep.

Go bear it to the Centaur
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
Till that
Get thee away.
Many a man would take you at your word
Exit

I am invited
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock
And afterward consort you till bed-time:
My present business calls me from you now.

Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.

Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop
So I
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.
ANTIPHOLUS
Stop in your wind
Where have you left the money that I gave you?
O
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it
ANTIPHOLUS
I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me
We being strangers here
So great a charge from thine own custody?
I pray you
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return
Methinks your maw
ANTIPHOLUS
Come
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
To me
ANTIPHOLUS
Come on
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
ANTIPHOLUS
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
I have some marks of yours upon my pate
If I should pay your worship those again
ANTIPHOLUS
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress
Your worship's wife
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner

What
What mean you
Nay

If it prove so

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

Why should their liberty than ours be more?
Because their business still lies out o' door.

Then let your will attend on their accords.
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

How if your husband start some other where?

Exit
Fie
His company must do his minions grace
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
What ruins are in me that can be found
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair
But
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
Self-harming jealousy! fie
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere
Sister
Would that alone
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!
Exeunt
SCENE II. A public place.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
Is wander'd forth
By computation and mine host's report.
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart. See
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
As you love strokes
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad
What answer
ANTIPHOLUS
Even now
I did not see you since you sent me hence

Villain
For which
I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
What means this jest? I pray you
ANTIPHOLUS
Yea
Think'st thou I jest? Hold
Beating him
Hold
Upon what bargain do you give it me?
ANTIPHOLUS
Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you
And make a common of my serious hours.
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
If you will jest with me
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
long
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But
ANTIPHOLUS
Dost thou not know?
Nothing
ANTIPHOLUS
Shall I tell you why?
Ay
a wherefore.
ANTIPHOLUS
Why
For urging it the second time to me.
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
nor reason?
Well
ANTIPHOLUS
Thank me
Marry
ANTIPHOLUS
I'll make you amends next
something. But say
No
ANTIPHOLUS
In good time
Basting.
ANTIPHOLUS
Well
If it be
ANTIPHOLUS
Your reason?
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting.
ANTIPHOLUS
Well
time for all things.
I durst have denied that
ANTIPHOLUS
By what rule
Marry
pate of father Time himself.
ANTIPHOLUS
Let's hear it.
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature.
ANTIPHOLUS
May he not do it by fine and recovery?
Yes
lost hair of another man.
ANTIPHOLUS
Why is Time such a niggard of hair
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
ANTIPHOLUS
Why
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
ANTIPHOLUS
Why
The plainer dealer
it in a kind of jollity.
ANTIPHOLUS
For what reason?
For two; and sound ones too.
ANTIPHOLUS
Nay
Sure ones
ANTIPHOLUS
Nay
Certain ones then.
ANTIPHOLUS
Name them.
The one
trimming; the other
drop in his porridge.
ANTIPHOLUS
You would all this time have proved there is no
time for all things.
Marry
lost by nature.
ANTIPHOLUS
But your reason was not substantial
time to recover.
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
to the world's end will have bald followers.
ANTIPHOLUS
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
But
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
Ay
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear
How comes it now
Thyself I call it
Ah
For know
A drop of water in the breaking gulf
How dearly would it touch me to the quick
And that this body
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
For if we too be one and thou play false
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
I live unstain'd
ANTIPHOLUS
Plead you to me
In Ephesus I am but two hours old
Who
Fie
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
ANTIPHOLUS
By Dromio?
By me?
By thee; and this thou didst return from him
ANTIPHOLUS
Did you converse
What is the course and drift of your compact?
I
ANTIPHOLUS
Villain
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
I never spake with her in all my life.
ANTIPHOLUS
How can she thus then call us by our names
How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt
Come
Thou art an elm
If aught possess thee from me
Who
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
ANTIPHOLUS
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
What
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty
Dromio
O
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
We talk with goblins
If we obey them not
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
Dromio
I am transformed
ANTIPHOLUS
I think thou art in mind
Nay
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou hast thine own form.
No
If thou art changed to aught
'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
'Tis so
But I should know her as well as she knows me.
Come
Come
Husband
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Sirrah
Come
ANTIPHOLUS
Am I in earth
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
Known unto these
I'll say as they say and persever so
Master
Ay; and let none enter
Come
Exeunt
ACT III
SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus
ANTIPHOLUS
Good Signior Angelo
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet
But here's a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart
Thou drunkard
Say what you will
That you beat me at the mart
If the skin were parchment
ANTIPHOLUS
I think thou art an ass.
Marry
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
I should kick
ANTIPHOLUS
You're sad
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
I hold your dainties cheap
welcome dear.
ANTIPHOLUS
O
Good meat
ANTIPHOLUS
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
ANTIPHOLUS
Ay
But though my cates be mean
Better cheer may you have
But
Maud
[Within]  Mome
Either get thee from the door
Dost thou conjure for wenches
for such store
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
the street.
[Within]  Let him walk from whence he came
catch cold on's feet.
ANTIPHOLUS
Who talks within there? ho
[Within]  Right
me wherefore.
ANTIPHOLUS
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.
[Within]  Nor to-day here you must not; come again
when you may.
ANTIPHOLUS
What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?
[Within]  The porter for this time
is Dromio.
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
The one ne'er got me credit
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place
name for an ass.
[Within]  What a coil is there
at the gate?
Let my master in
[Within]  Faith
And so tell your master.
O Lord
Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?
[Within]  Have at you with another; that's--When?
can you tell?
[Within]  If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce
answered him well.
Do you hear
OF EPHESUS
[Within]  I thought to have asked you.
[Within]  And you said no.
So
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou baggage
[Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?
Master
[Within]  Let him knock till it ache.
ANTIPHOLUS
You'll cry for this
[Within]  What needs all that
[Within]  Who is that at the door that keeps all
this noise?
[Within]  By my troth
unruly boys.
ANTIPHOLUS
Are you there
[Within]  Your wife
If you went in pain
Here is neither cheer
fain have either.
In debating which was best
They stand at the door
ANTIPHOLUS
There is something in the wind
You would say so
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
It would make a man mad as a buck
ANTIPHOLUS
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
[Within]  Break any breaking here
knave's pate.
A man may break a word with you
[Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
thee
Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee
[Within]  Ay
ANTIPHOLUS
Well
A crow without feather? Master
For a fish without a fin
If a crow help us in
ANTIPHOLUS
Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
Have patience
Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
The unviolated honour of your wife.
Once this
And doubt not
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me: depart in patience
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession
ANTIPHOLUS
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet
I know a wench of excellent discourse
There will we dine. This woman that I mean
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
To her will we to dinner.
To Angelo
Get you home
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
Bring it
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
Upon mine hostess there: good sir
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS
Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same.
Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
And may it be that you have quite forgot
A husband's office? shall
Even in the spring of love
Shall love
If you did wed my sister for her wealth
Or if you like elsewhere
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
Look sweet
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
Bear a fair presence
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
'Tis double wrong
And let her read it in thy looks at board:
Shame hath a bastard fame
Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.
Alas
Though others have the arm
We in your motion turn and you may move us.
Then
Comfort my sister
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
ANTIPHOLUS
Sweet mistress--what your name is else
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Than our earth's wonder
Teach me
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? would you create me new?
Transform me then
But if that I am I
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine
Far more
O
Sing
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
Let Love
What
ANTIPHOLUS
Not mad
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
ANTIPHOLUS
For gazing on your beams
Gaze where you should
ANTIPHOLUS
As good to wink
Why call you me love? call my sister so.
ANTIPHOLUS
Thy sister's sister.
That's my sister.
ANTIPHOLUS
No;
It is thyself
All this my sister is
ANTIPHOLUS
Call thyself sister
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
Give me thy hand.
O
I'll fetch my sister
Exit
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS
Why
Do you know me
am I myself?
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou art Dromio
I am an ass
What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?
Marry
that claims me
ANTIPHOLUS
What claim lays she to thee?
Marry sir
horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that
being a beast
ANTIPHOLUS
What is she?
A very reverent body; ay
not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
but lean luck in the match
wondrous fat marriage.
ANTIPHOLUS
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
Marry
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
warrant
Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday
ANTIPHOLUS
What complexion is she of?
Swart
clean kept: for why
shoes in the grime of it.
ANTIPHOLUS
That's a fault that water will mend.
No
ANTIPHOLUS
What's her name?
Nell
an ell and three quarters
hip to hip.
ANTIPHOLUS
Then she bears some breadth?
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
she is spherical
countries in her.
ANTIPHOLUS
In what part of her body stands Ireland?
Marry
ANTIPHOLUS
Where Scotland?
I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
ANTIPHOLUS
Where France?
In her forehead; armed and reverted
against her heir.
ANTIPHOLUS
Where England?
I looked for the chalky cliffs
whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin
ANTIPHOLUS
Where Spain?
Faith
ANTIPHOLUS
Where America
Oh
rubies
aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
ANTIPHOLUS
Where stood Belgia
Oh
drudge
Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
privy marks I had about me
shoulder
left arm
And
faith and my heart of steel
me turn i' the wheel.
ANTIPHOLUS
Go hie thee presently
An if the wind blow any way from shore
If any bark put forth
If every one knows us and we know none
As from a bear a man would run for life
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
There's none but witches do inhabit here;
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
She that doth call me husband
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister
But
Enter ANGELO with the chain
Master Antipholus
ANTIPHOLUS
Ay
I know it well
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
ANTIPHOLUS
What is your will that I shall do with this?
What please yourself
ANTIPHOLUS
Made it for me
Not once
Go home with it and please your wife withal;
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
And then receive my money for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS
I pray you
You are a merry man
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
What I should think of this
But this I think
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
I see a man here needs not live by shifts
I'll to the mart
If any ship put out
Exit
ACT IV
SCENE I. A public place.
Enter Second Merchant
You know since Pentecost the sum is due
Nor now I had not
To Persia
Therefore make present satisfaction
Even just the sum that I do owe to you
Is growing to me by Antipholus
He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
I shall receive the money for the same.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's
That labour may you save: see where he comes.
ANTIPHOLUS
While I go to the goldsmith's house
And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
Among my wife and her confederates
But
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.
I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.
Exit
ANTIPHOLUS
A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
I promised your presence and the chain;
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
Belike you thought our love would last too long
Saving your merry humour
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
I pray you
ANTIPHOLUS
I am not furnish'd with the present money;
Besides
Good signior
And with you take the chain and bid my wife
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS
No; bear it with you
Well
ANTIPHOLUS
An if I have not
Or else you may return without your money.
Nay
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman
ANTIPHOLUS
Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
I should have chid you for not bringing it
The hour steals on; I pray you
You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS
Why
Come
Either send the chain or send me by some token.
ANTIPHOLUS
Fie
My business cannot brook this dalliance.
Good sir
If not
ANTIPHOLUS
I answer you! what should I answer you?
The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS
I owe you none till I receive the chain.
You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
You wrong me more
Consider how it stands upon my credit.
Well
I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.
This touches me in reputation.
Either consent to pay this sum for me
Or I attach you by this officer.
ANTIPHOLUS
Consent to pay thee that I never had!
Arrest me
Here is thy fee; arrest him
I do arrest you
ANTIPHOLUS
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
But
As all the metal in your shop will answer.
Sir
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
Master
That stays but till her owner comes aboard
The oil
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
But for their owner
ANTIPHOLUS
How now! a madman! Why
A ship you sent me to
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou drunken slave
And told thee to what purpose and what end.
You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
You sent me to the bay
ANTIPHOLUS
I will debate this matter at more leisure
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
To Adriana
Give her this key
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
Tell her I am arrested in the street
And that shall bail me; hie thee
On
Exeunt Second Merchant
To Adriana! that is where we dined
She is too big
Thither I must
Exit
SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
Ah
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
Look'd he or red or pale
What observation madest thou in this case
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
First he denied you had in him no right.
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
And true he swore
Then pleaded I for you.
And what said he?
That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
With words that in an honest suit might move.
First he did praise my beauty
Didst speak him fair?
Have patience
I cannot
My tongue
He is deformed
Vicious
Stigmatical in making
Who would be jealous then of such a one?
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
Ah
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
My heart prays for him
Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
Here! go; the desk
How hast thou lost thy breath?
By running fast.
Where is thy master
No
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
A fiend
A wolf
A back-friend
countermands
The passages of alleys
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.
Why
I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.
What
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him
Will you send him
Go fetch it
Exit Luciana
This I wonder at
Tell me
Not on a band
A chain
What
No
It was two ere I left him
strikes one.
The hours come back! that did I never hear.
O
very fear.
As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!
Time is a very bankrupt
worth
Nay
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
If Time be in debt and theft
Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse
Go
And bring thy master home immediately.
Come
Conceit
Exeunt
SCENE III. A public place.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
And every one doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me; some invite me;
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
Some offer me commodities to buy:
Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me
Sure
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master
you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?
ANTIPHOLUS
What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
behind you
forsake your liberty.
ANTIPHOLUS
I understand thee not.
No? why
bass-viol
and 'rests them; he
men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
morris-pike.
ANTIPHOLUS
What
Ay
any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
thinks a man always going to bed
give you good rest!'
ANTIPHOLUS
Well
Why
bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
you hindered by the sergeant
Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
deliver you.
ANTIPHOLUS
The fellow is distract
And here we wander in illusions:
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
Enter a Courtezan
Well met
I see
Is that the chain you promised me to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS
Satan
Master
ANTIPHOLUS
It is the devil.
Nay
she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as
much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
written
light is an effect of fire
ergo
Your man and you are marvellous merry
Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?
Master
long spoon.
ANTIPHOLUS
Why
Marry
the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS
Avoid then
Thou art
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner
Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail
But she
Master
I pray you
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
ANTIPHOLUS
Avaunt
'Fly pride
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
Now
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats
Both one and other he denies me now.
The reason that I gather he is mad
Belike his wife
My way is now to hie home to his house
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
For forty ducats is too much to lose.
Exit
SCENE IV. A street.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer
ANTIPHOLUS
Fear me not
I'll give thee
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus
Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
How now
Here's that
ANTIPHOLUS
But where's the money?
Why
ANTIPHOLUS
Five hundred ducats
I'll serve you
ANTIPHOLUS
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
To a rope's-end
ANTIPHOLUS
And to that end
Beating him
Good sir
Nay
Good
Nay
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou whoreson
I would I were senseless
your blows.
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows
ass.
I am an ass
ears. I have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold
heats me with beating; when I am warm
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
I return; nay
beggar wont her brat; and
lamed me
ANTIPHOLUS
Come
Enter ADRIANA
Mistress
rather
rope's-end.'
ANTIPHOLUS
Wilt thou still talk?
Beating him
How say you now? is not your husband mad?
His incivility confirms no less.
Good Doctor Pinch
Establish him in his true sense again
Alas
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
ANTIPHOLUS
There is my hand
Striking him
I charge thee
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
ANTIPHOLUS
Peace
O
ANTIPHOLUS
You minion
Did this companion with the saffron face
Revel and feast it at my house to-day
And I denied to enter in my house?
O husband
Where would you had remain'd until this time
ANTIPHOLUS
Dined at home! Thou villain
Sir
ANTIPHOLUS
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
Perdie
ANTIPHOLUS
And did not she herself revile me there?
Sans fable
ANTIPHOLUS
Did not her kitchen-maid rail
Certes
ANTIPHOLUS
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
In verity you did; my bones bear witness
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
Alas
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
But surely master
ANTIPHOLUS
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
He came to me and I deliver'd it.
And I am witness with her that she did.
God and the rope-maker bear me witness
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
Mistress
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
ANTIPHOLUS
Say
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
I did not
And
But I confess
Dissembling villain
ANTIPHOLUS
Dissembling harlot
And art confederate with a damned pack
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
That would behold in me this shameful sport.
Enter three or four
O
More company! The fiend is strong within him.
Ay me
ANTIPHOLUS
What
To make a rescue?
Masters
He is my prisoner
Go bind this man
They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus
What wilt thou do
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
He is my prisoner: if I let him go
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor
Good master doctor
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
ANTIPHOLUS
O most unhappy strumpet!
Master
ANTIPHOLUS
Out on thee
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad
cry 'The devil!'
God help
Go bear him hence. Sister
Exeunt all but Adriana
Say now
One Angelo
I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
Two hundred ducats.
Say
Due for a chain your husband had of him.
He did bespeak a chain for me
When as your husband all in rage to-day
Came to my house and took away my ring--
The ring I saw upon his finger now--
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
It may be so
Come
I long to know the truth hereof at large.
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn
God
And come with naked swords.
Let's call more help to have them bound again.
Away! they'll kill us.
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
ANTIPHOLUS
I see these witches are afraid of swords.
She that would be your wife now ran from you.
ANTIPHOLUS
Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
Faith
no harm: you saw they speak us fair
methinks they are such a gentle nation that
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
me
turn witch.
ANTIPHOLUS
I will not stay to-night for all the town;
Therefore away
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. A street before a Priory.
Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO
I am sorry
But
How is the man esteemed here in the city?
Of very reverend reputation
His word might bear my wealth at any time.
Speak softly; yonder
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse
'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
Good sir
Signior Antipholus
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
And
This chain which now you wear so openly:
Beside the charge
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
ANTIPHOLUS
I think I had; I never did deny it.
Yes
ANTIPHOLUS
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
These ears of mine
Fie on thee
To walk where any honest man resort.
ANTIPHOLUS
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
Against thee presently
I dare
They draw
Enter ADRIANA
Hold
Some get within him
Bind Dromio too
Run
This is some priory. In
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory
Enter the Lady Abbess
Be quiet
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
Let us come in
And bear him home for his recovery.
I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
How long hath this possession held the man?
This week he hath been heavy
But till this afternoon his passion
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
To none of these
Namely
You should for that have reprehended him.
Why
Ay
As roughly as my modesty would let me.
Haply
And in assemblies too.
Ay
It was the copy of our conference:
In bed he slept not for my urging it;
At board he fed not for my urging it;
Alone
In company I often glanced it;
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
The venom clamours of a jealous woman
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
Sweet recreation barr'd
But moody and dull melancholy
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
In food
To be disturb'd
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
She never reprehended him but mildly
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
She did betray me to my own reproof.
Good people enter and lay hold on him.
No
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary
Till I have brought him to his wits again
I will attend my husband
And therefore let me have him home with me.
Be patient; for I will not let him stir
Till I have used the approved means I have
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
I will not hence and leave my husband here:
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
To separate the husband and the wife.
Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.
Exit
Complain unto the duke of this indignity.
Come
And never rise until my tears and prayers
Have won his grace to come in person hither
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.
By this
Anon
Comes this way to the melancholy vale
Upon what cause?
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant
Against the laws and statutes of this town
See where they come: we will behold his death.
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
Enter DUKE SOLINUS
Yet once again proclaim it publicly
Justice
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
May it please your grace
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
That desperately he hurried through the street
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses
Rings
Once did I get him bound and sent him home
Anon
And with his mad attendant and himself
Into this abbey
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
And will not suffer us to fetch him out
Therefore
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
Long since thy husband served me in my wars
Go
And bid the lady abbess come to me.
I will determine this before I stir.
Enter a Servant
O mistress
My master and his man are both broke loose
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
And ever
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
My master preaches patience to him and the while
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool
Peace
Mistress
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
He cries for you
Cry within
Hark
Come
Ay me
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
And now he's there
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus
ANTIPHOLUS
Justice
Even for the service that long since I did thee
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
That then I lost for thee
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote
ANTIPHOLUS
Justice
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife
Even in the strength and height of injury!
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
Discover how
ANTIPHOLUS
This day
A grievous fault! Say
No
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal!
Ne'er may I look on day
O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
In this the madman justly chargeth them.
ANTIPHOLUS
My liege
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
That goldsmith there
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain
Our dinner done
And in his company that gentleman.
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him received the chain
He did arrest me with an officer.
I did obey
For certain ducats: he with none return'd
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house.
By the way we met
My wife
Of vile confederates. Along with them
They brought one Pinch
They fell upon me
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man
Till
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.
My lord
But had he such a chain of thee or no?
He had
Besides
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
After you first forswore it on the mart:
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
And then you fled into this abbey here
ANTIPHOLUS
I never came within these abbey-walls
I never saw the chain
And this is false you burden me withal.
Why
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
If here you housed him
If he were mad
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
Denies that saying. Sirrah
Sir
He did
ANTIPHOLUS
'Tis true
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
As sure
Why
I think you are all mated or stark mad.
Exit one to Abbess
Most mighty duke
Haply I see a friend will save my life
And pay the sum that may deliver me.
Speak freely
Is not your name
And is not that your bondman
Within this hour I was his bondman sir
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
I am sure you both of you remember me.
Ourselves we do remember
For lately we were bound
You are not Pinch's patient
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
I never saw you in my life till now.
O
Have written strange defeatures in my face:
But tell me yet
ANTIPHOLUS
Neither.
Dromio
No
I am sure thou dost.
Ay
man denies
Not know my voice! O time's extremity
In seven short years
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
ANTIPHOLUS
I never saw my father in my life.
But seven years since
ANTIPHOLUS
The duke and all that know me in the city
Can witness with me that it is not so
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.
I tell thee
Have I been patron to Antipholus
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
Re-enter AEMILIA
Most mighty duke
All gather to see them
I see two husbands
One of these men is Genius to the other;
And so of these. Which is the natural man
I
I
ANTIPHOLUS
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?
O
Whoever bound him
And gain a husband by his liberty.
Speak
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
O
If I dream not
If thou art she
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see me in.
Why
These two Antipholuses
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea
These are the parents to these children
Antipholus
ANTIPHOLUS
No
Stay
ANTIPHOLUS
I came from Corinth
And I with him.
ANTIPHOLUS
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior
Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS
I
And are not you my husband?
ANTIPHOLUS
No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS
And so do I; yet did she call me so:
And this fair gentlewoman
To Luciana
What I told you then
If this be not a dream I see and hear.
That is the chain
ANTIPHOLUS
I think it be
ANTIPHOLUS
And you
I think I did
I sent you money
No
ANTIPHOLUS
This purse of ducats I received from you
I see we still did meet each other's man
ANTIPHOLUS
These ducats pawn I for my father here.
It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
Sir
ANTIPHOLUS
There
Renowned duke
To go with us into the abbey here
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
And all that are assembled in this place
Have suffer'd wrong
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
Of you
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
The duke
After so long grief
With all my heart
Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse
Master
ANTIPHOLUS
Dromio
Your goods that lay at host
ANTIPHOLUS
He speaks to me. I am your master
Come
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus
There is a fat friend at your master's house
She now shall be my sister
Methinks you are my glass
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
Not I
That's a question: how shall we try it?
We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.
Nay
We came into the world like brother and brother;
And now let's go hand in hand
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. Rome. A street.
Enter a company of mutinous Citizens
Before we proceed any further
Speak
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved. resolved.
First
We know't
Let us kill him
Is't a verdict?
No more talking on't; let it be done: away
One word
We are accounted poor citizens
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity
wholesome
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes
speak this in hunger for bread
Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well; and could be content to give him good
report fort
Nay
I say unto you
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is
What he cannot help in his nature
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
If I must not
he hath faults
Shouts within
What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
Come
Soft! who comes here?
Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
the people.
He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
What work's
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak
Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.
Why
We cannot
I tell you
Have the patricians of you. For your wants
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state
The way it takes
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth
Your knees to them
Thither where more attends you
The helms o' the state
Care for us! True
yet: suffer us to famish
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich
piercing statutes daily
the poor. If the wars eat us not up
there's all the love they bear us.
Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
But
To stale 't a little more.
Well
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but
you
There was a time when all the body's members
Rebell'd against the belly
That only like a gulf it did remain
I' the midst o' the body
Like labour with the rest
Did see and hear
Unto the appetite and affection common
Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
Well
Sir
For
As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
To the discontented members
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you.
Your belly's answer? What!
The kingly-crowned head
With other muniments and petty helps
In this our fabric
What then?
'Fore me
Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd
Well
The former agents
I will tell you
If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
Patience awhile
Ye're long about it.
Note me this
Your most grave belly was deliberate
'True is it
Of the whole body: but
And
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live: and though that all at once
Ay
'Though all at once cannot
See what I do deliver out to each
From me do back receive the flour of all
It was an answer: how apply you this?
The senators of Rome are this good belly
Their counsels and their cares
Touching the weal o' the common
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
And no way from yourselves. What do you think
I the great toe! why the great toe?
For that
Thou rascal
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
The one side must have bale.
Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
Hail
Thanks. What's the matter
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring. What would you have
Where foxes
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it.
Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate; and your affections are
A sick man's appetite
Which would increase his evil. He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
With every minute you do change a mind
You cry against the noble senate
Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
For corn at their own rates; whereof
Hang 'em! They say!
They'll sit by the fire
What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise
and give out
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
grain enough!
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
With thousands of these quarter'd slaves
As I could pick my lance.
Nay
For though abundantly they lack discretion
They are dissolved: hang 'em!
They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
They vented their complainings; which being answer'd
To break the heart of generosity
As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon
What is granted them?
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
The rabble should have first unroof'd the city
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
For insurrection's arguing.
This is strange.
Go
Enter a Messenger
Where's Caius Marcius?
Here: what's the matter?
The news is
I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
Our musty superfluity. See
Enter COMINIUS
Marcius
The Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader
I sin in envying his nobility
You have fought together.
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
Upon my party
Only my wars with him: he is a lion
That I am proud to hunt.
Then
It is your former promise.
Sir
And I am constant. Titus Lartius
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
What
No
I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other
O
Your company to the Capitol; where
[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.
To MARCIUS
Right worthy you priority.
Noble Marcius!
[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone!
Nay
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners
Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people
Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
Nay. but his taunts.
Being moved
Be-mock the modest moon.
The present wars devour him: he is grown
Too proud to be so valiant.
Such a nature
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius.
Fame
Better be held nor more attain'd than by
A place below the first: for what miscarries
Shall be the general's fault
To the utmost of a man
Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
Had borne the business!'
Besides
Of his demerits rob Cominius.
Come:
Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
Though Marcius earned them not
To Marcius shall be honours
In aught he merit not.
Let's hence
How the dispatch is made
Upon this present action.
Lets along.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Corioli. The Senate-house.
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators
So
And know how we proceed.
Is it not yours?
What ever have been thought on in this state
Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
I have the letter here; yes
Reads
'They have press'd a power
Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd
Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
Consider of it.'
Our army's in the field
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us.
Nor did you think it folly
To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
They needs must show themselves; which
in the hatching
We shall be shorten'd in our aim
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot.
Noble Aufidius
Let us alone to guard Corioli:
If they set down before 's
Bring your army; but
They've not prepared for us.
O
I speak from certainties. Nay
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet
Till one can do no more.
The gods assist you!
And keep your honours safe!
Farewell.
Farewell.
Farewell.
Exeunt
SCENE III. Rome. A room in Marcius' house.
"Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA	they set them down on two low stools"
I pray you
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way
for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding
how honour would become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall
renown made it not stir
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
war I sent him; from whence he returned
bound with oak. I tell thee
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.
But had he died in the business
Then his good report should have been my son; I
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
Marcius
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Enter a Gentlewoman
Madam
Beseech you
Indeed
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum
Methinks I see him stamp thus
'Come on
With his mail'd hand then wiping
Or all or lose his hire.
His bloody brow! O Jupiter
Away
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba
Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
At Grecian sword
Exit Gentlewoman
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
And tread upon his neck.
Enter VALERIA
My ladies both
Sweet madam.
I am glad to see your ladyship.
How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
What are you sewing here? A fine spot
faith. How does your little son?
I thank your ladyship; well
He had rather see the swords
look upon his school-master.
O' my word
very pretty boy. O' my troth
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he caught it
again; and after it again; and over and over he
comes
fall enraged him
teeth and tear it; O
it!
One on 's father's moods.
Indeed

Come

No
Not out of doors!
She shall

Fie
I will wish her speedy strength
my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
Why
'Tis not to save labour
You would be another Penelope: yet
the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
were sensible as your finger
pricking it for pity. Come
No
In truth
excellent news of your husband.
O
Verily
him last night.
Indeed
In earnest
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general is gone
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true
Give me excuse

Let her alone
disease our better mirth.
In troth
Come
solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
No
you much mirth.
Well
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Before Corioli.
Enter
Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
My horse to yours
'Tis done.
Agreed.
Say
They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
So
I'll buy him of you.
No
For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
How far off lie these armies?
Within this mile and half.
Then shall we hear their 'larum
Now
They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls
Tutus Aufidius
No
Drums afar off
Hark! our drums
Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls
They'll open of themselves.
Alarum afar off
Hark you. far off!
There is Aufidius; list
Amongst your cloven army.
O
Their noise be our instruction. Ladders
Enter the army of the Volsces
They fear us not
Now put your shields before your hearts
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce
Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing
All the contagion of the south light on you
Plaster you o'er
Further than seen and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home
And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
If you'll stand fast
Another alarum. The Volsces fly
So
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them
Enters the gates
Fool-hardiness; not I.
Nor I.
MARCIUS is shut in
See
To the pot
Alarum continues
Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS
What is become of Marcius?
Slain
Following the fliers at the very heels
O noble fellow!
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
A carbuncle entire
Even to Cato's wish
Only in strokes; but
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
Were feverous and did tremble.
Re-enter MARCIUS
Look
O
Let's fetch him off
They fight
SCENE V. Corioli. A street.
Enter certain Romans
This will I carry to Rome.
And I this.
A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
Alarum continues still afar off
Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet
See here these movers that do prize their hours
At a crack'd drachm! Cushions
Bury with those that wore them
And hark
There is the man of my soul's hate
Convenient numbers to make good the city;
Whilst I
To help Cominius.
Worthy sir
Thy exercise hath been too violent for
A second course of fight.
Sir
My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
I will appear
Now the fair goddess
Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman
Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest! So
Thou worthiest Marcius!
Exit MARCIUS
Go
Call thither all the officers o' the town
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Near the camp of Cominius.
Enter COMINIUS
Breathe you
we are come off
Like Romans
The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
Lead their successes as we wish our own
fronts encountering
Enter a Messenger
Thy news?
The citizens of Corioli have issued
I saw our party to their trenches driven
Though thou speak'st truth
How long is't since?
Above an hour
'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
Spies of the Volsces
Held me in chase
Three or four miles about
Who's yonder
He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
Before-time seen him thus.
[Within]                 Come I too late?
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
From every meaner man.
Enter MARCIUS
Come I too late?
Ay
O
In arms as sound as when I woo'd
As merry as when our nuptial day was done
Flower of warriors
As with a man busied about decrees:
Condemning some to death
Ransoming him
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
Where is he? call him hither.
Let him alone;
He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen
The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
From rascals worse than they.
But how prevail'd you?
Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
If not
Marcius
Retire to win our purpose.
How lies their battle? know you on which side
They have placed their men of trust?
As I guess
I do beseech you
We have made to endure friends
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
And that you not delay the present
Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to
Deny your asking: take your choice of those
That best can aid your action.
Those are they
That most are willing. If any such be here--
As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
Lesser his person than an ill report;
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself;
Let him alone
They all shout and wave their swords
O
If these shows be not outward
But is four Volsces? none of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his. A certain number
from all: the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight
And four shall quickly draw out my command
March on
Make good this ostentation
Divide in all with us.
Exeunt
SCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.

So
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
For a short holding: if we lose the field
Fear not our care
Hence
Our guider
Exeunt
SCENE VIII. A field of battle.
Alarum as in battle. Enter
I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.
We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
Let the first budger die the other's slave
If I fly
Within these three hours
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest.
Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny
They fight
Officious
In your condemned seconds.
Exeunt
SCENE IX. The Roman camp.
Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.  Enter
If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
dull tribunes
Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast
Enter TITUS LARTIUS
O general
Hadst thou beheld--
Pray now
As you have done; that's what I can; induced
As you have been; that's for my country:
He that has but effected his good will
Hath overta'en mine act.
You shall not be
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
Worse than a theft
In sign of what you are
What you have done--before our army hear me.
I have some wounds upon me
To hear themselves remember'd.
Should they not
The treasure in this field achieved and city
Your only choice.
I thank you
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing.
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'  cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare
May these same instruments
I' the field prove flatterers
Made all of false-faced soothing!
When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk
No more
My nose that bled
Which
You shout me forth
In acclamations hyperbolical;
As if I loved my little should be dieted
In praises sauced with lies.
Too modest are you;
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly: by your patience
Wears this war's garland: in token of the which
The addition nobly ever!
Flourish. Trumpets sound
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
I will go wash;
And when my face is fair
Whether I blush or no: howbeit
I mean to stride your steed
To undercrest your good addition
To the fairness of my power.
So
Where
To Rome of our success. You
The best
I shall
The gods begin to mock me. I
Refused most princely gifts
Of my lord general.
Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
I sometime lay here in Corioli
At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
But then Aufidius was with in my view
To give my poor host freedom.
O
Were he the butcher of my son
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him
Marcius
By Jupiter! forgot.
I am weary; yea
Have we no wine here?
Go we to our tent:
The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
It should be look'd to: come.
Exeunt
SCENE X. The camp of the Volsces.
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS
The town is ta'en!
'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
Condition!
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot
What good condition can a treaty find
I' the part that is at mercy? Five times

Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.

With only suffering stain by him; for him
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary
Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
My hate to Marcius: where I find him
At home
Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
Be hostages for Rome.
Will not you go?
I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
How the world goes
I may spur on my journey.
I shall

ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.
Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people
love not Marcius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
Pray you
The lamb.
Ay
noble Marcius.
He's a lamb indeed
He's a bear indeed
are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
Well
In what enormity is Marcius poor in
have not in abundance?
He's poor in no one fault
Especially in pride.
And topping all others in boasting.
This is strange now: do you two know how you are
censured here in the city
right-hand file? do you?
Why
Because you talk of pride now
Well
Why
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
give your dispositions the reins
your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
being proud?
We do it not alone
I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
are many
single: your abilities are too infant-like for
doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks
O that you could!
What then
Why
any in Rome.
Menenius
I am known to be a humorous patrician
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
of the morning: what I think I utter
malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely
crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
delivered the matter well
compound with the major part of your syllables: and
though I must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men
tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
the map of my microcosm
well enough too? what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character
known well enough too?
Come
You know neither me
are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party
pinched with the colic
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
patience; and
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is
a pair of strange ones.
Come
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol.
Our very priests must become mockers
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you speak best unto the purpose
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
cushion
saddle. Yet you must be saying
who in a cheap estimation
since Deucalion
best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worships: more of your conversation would
infect my brain
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside
Enter VOLUMNIA
How now
your eyes so fast?
Honourable Menenius
the love of Juno
Ha! Marcius coming home!
Ay
approbation.
Take my cap
Marcius coming home!
Nay
Look
another
at home for you.
I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
me!
Yes
A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is but empiricutic
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
O
O
So do I too
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
On's brows: Menenius
with the oaken garland.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius writes
Aufidius got off.
And 'twas time for him too
an he had stayed by him
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli
that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
Good ladies
has letters from the general
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly
In troth
Wondrous! ay
true purchasing.
The gods grant them true!
True! pow
True! I'll be sworn they are true.
Where is he wounded?
To the Tribunes
God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people
stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
One i' the neck
nine that I know.
He had
wounds upon him.
Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
A shout and flourish
Hark! the trumpets.
These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
carries noise
Death
Which
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the  general

In honour follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome

Welcome to Rome
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now
Look
O
For my prosperity!
Kneels
Nay
My gentle Marcius
By deed-achieving honour newly named
What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
But O
My gracious silence
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home
Now
And live you yet?
To VALERIA
O my sweet lady
I know not where to turn: O
And welcome
A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
And I could laugh
A curse begin at very root on's heart
That Rome should dote on: yet
at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome
We call a nettle but a nettle and
The faults of fools but folly.
Ever right.
Menenius ever
Give way there
[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA]  Your hand
Ere in our own house I do shade my head
From whom I have received not only greetings
I have lived

And the buildings of my fancy: only
There's one thing wanting
Our Rome will cast upon thee.
Know
On
Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state
All tongues speak of him
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck
With variable complexions
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture.
On the sudden
Then our office may
He cannot temperately transport his honours
From where he should begin and end
Lose those he hath won.
In that there's comfort.
Doubt not
The commoners
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do't.
I heard him swear
Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility;
Nor showing
To the people
'Tis right.
It was his word: O
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.
'Tis most like he will.
It shall be to him then as our good wills
So it must fall out
To him or our authorities. For an end
He still hath held them; that to's power he would
Have made them mules
Dispropertied their freedoms
Than camels in the war
Only for bearing burdens
For sinking under them.
This
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall touch the people--which time shall not want
As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever.
Enter a Messenger
What's the matter?
You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
That Marcius shall be consul:
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
I never saw the like.
Let's to the Capitol;
And carry with us ears and eyes for the time
Have with you.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.
Enter two Officers
Come
for consulships?
Three
Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud
loves not the common people.
Faith
flattered the people
be many that they have loved
wherefore: so that
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly see't.
If he did not care whether he had their love or no
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him; and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite. Now
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes
He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
planted his honours in their eyes
in their hearts
silent
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise
malice
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way
are coming.
A sennet. Enter
Having determined of the Volsces and
To send for Titus Lartius
Hath thus stood for his country: therefore
The present consul
In our well-found successes
A little of that worthy work perform'd
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus
We met here both to thank and to remember
With honours like himself.
Speak
Leave nothing out for length
Rather our state's defective for requital
Than we to stretch it out.
To the Tribunes
Masters o' the people
We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly.
Which the rather
We shall be blest to do
A kinder value of the people than
He hath hereto prized them at.
That's off
I would you rather had been silent. Please you
To hear Cominius speak?
Most willingly;
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it.
He loves your people
But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
Worthy Cominius
CORIOLANUS offers to go away
Nay
Sit
What you have nobly done.
Your horror's pardon:
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.
Sir
My words disbench'd you not.
No
You soothed not
your people
Pray now
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
To hear my nothings monster'd.
Exit
Masters of the people
That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed
I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
That valour is the chiefest virtue
Most dignifies the haver: if it be
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
Man-enter'd thus
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
A vessel under sail
And fell below his stem: his sword
He was a thing of blood
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
The mortal gate of the city
With shunless destiny; aidless came off
Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
When
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate
Run reeking o'er the lives of men
'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
Both field and city ours
To ease his breast with panting.
Worthy man!
He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him.
Our spoils he kick'd at
The common muck of the world: he covets less
Than misery itself would give; rewards
His deeds with doing them
To spend the time to end it.
He's right noble:
Let him be call'd for.
Call Coriolanus.
He doth appear.
Re-enter CORIOLANUS
The senate
To make thee consul.
I do owe them still
My life and services.
It then remains
That you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you
Put on the gown
That I may pass this doing.
Sir
Must have their voices; neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony.
Put them not to't:
Pray you
Take to you
It is apart
That I shall blush in acting
Be taken from the people.
Mark you that?
To brag unto them
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide
Of their breath only!
Do not stand upon't.
We recommend to you
Wish we all joy and honour.
To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
You see how he intends to use the people.
May they perceive's intent! He will require them
Should be in them to give.
Come

Enter seven or eight Citizens
Once
We may
We have power in ourselves to do it
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds
tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so
he tell us his noble deeds
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous
which we being members
monstrous members.
And to make us no better thought of
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
We have been called so of many; not that our heads
are some brown
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull
once to all the points o' the compass.
Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
fly?
Nay
will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head
if it were at liberty
Why that way?
To lose itself in a fog
melted away with rotten dews
for conscience sake
You are never without your tricks: you may
Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
that's no matter
say
never a worthier man.
Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility
Here he comes

O sir
The worthiest men have done't?
What must I say?
'I Pray
My tongue to such a pace:--'Look
I got them in my country's service
Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
From the noise of our own drums.'
O me
You must not speak of that: you must desire them
To think upon you.
Think upon me! hang 'em!
I would they would forget me
Which our divines lose by 'em.
You'll mar all:

rather to have my hat than my heart

We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
you our voices heartily.
You have received many wounds for your country.
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of your voices
The gods give you joy
Exeunt
Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here
What custom wills
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so
To one that would do thus. I am half through;
The one part suffer'd

Here come more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six

Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy

You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice: remains

Anon do meet the senate.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged:
The people do admit you
To meet anon
Where? at the senate-house?
There
May I change these garments?
You may

I'll keep you company. Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
Fare you well.
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
He has it now
'Tis warm at 's heart.
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?
Re-enter Citizens
How now
He has our voices
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen
Certainly
He flouted us downright.
No
Not one amongst us
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit
Why
No
He said he had wounds
in private;
And with his hat
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
your voices
Why either were you ignorant to see't
To yield your voices?
Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now
A place of potency and sway o' the state
Fast foe to the plebeii
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love
Thus to have said
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage
And pass'd him unelected.
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?
Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that did not ask
Your sued-for tongues?
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
And will deny him:
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
Get you hence instantly
Their liberties; make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.
Let them assemble
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride
With what contempt he wore the humble weed
The apprehension of his present portance
After the inveterate hate he bears you.
Lay
A fault on us
Cast your election on him.
Say
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections
Than what you should
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
Ay
How youngly he began to serve his country
That Ancus Marcius
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were
And  [Censorinus
One thus descended
To be set high in place
To your remembrances: but you have found
Your sudden approbation.
Say
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
And presently
We will so: almost all
Repent in their election.

So then the Volsces stand but as at first

They are worn
Their banners wave again.
Saw you Aufidius?
On safe-guard he  came to me; and did curse
Against the Volsces
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
Spoke he of me?
He did
How? what?
How often he had met you
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most
To hopeless restitution
Be call'd your vanquisher.

At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
Behold
For they do prank them in authority
Pass no further.
Ha! what is that?
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
What makes this change?
The matter?
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
Cominius
Have I had children's voices?
Tribunes
The people are incensed against him.
Stop
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You being their mouths
Have you not set them on?
Be calm
It is a purposed thing
Suffer't
Nor ever will be ruled.
Call't not a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people
Time-pleasers
Why
Not to them all.
Have you inform'd them sithence?
How! I inform them!
You are like to do such business.
Not unlike
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds
Your fellow tribune.
You show too much of that
For which the people stir: if you will pass
To where you are bound
Let's be calm.
The people are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not Rome
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub
I' the plain way of his merit.
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech
Not now
Not in this heat
Now
For the mutable
Regard me as I do not flatter
Therein behold themselves: I say again
The cockle of rebellion
Which they have given to beggars.
Well
No more words
How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood
Coin words till their decay against those measles
The very way to catch them.
You speak o' the people
A man of their infirmity.
'Twere well
We let the people know't.
What
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?
'Twas from the canon.
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why
Given Hydra here to choose an officer
The horn and noise o' the monster's
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch
Then vail your ignorance; if none
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.
Well
Whoever gave that counsel
The corn o' the storehouse gratis
Sometime in Greece
Well
Though there the people had more absolute power
The ruin of the state.
Why
One that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons
Was not our recompense
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutinies and revolts
Most valour
Which they have often made against the senate
Of our so frank donation. Well
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
We are the greater poll
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.
Come
Enough
No
What may be sworn by
Insult without all reason
Of general ignorance
Real necessities
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd
You that will be less fearful than discreet
More than you doubt the change on't
A noble life before a long
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't
Has said enough.
Has spoken like a traitor
As traitors do.
Thou wretch
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
On whom depending

Manifest treason!

To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
What is the city but the people?
TRUE
By the consent of all
The people's magistrates.
You so remain.
And so are like to do.
That is the way to lay the city flat;
To bring the roof to the foundation
This deserves death.
Or let us stand to our authority
We were elected theirs
Of present death.
Therefore lay hold of him;
Bear him to the rock Tarpeian
Into destruction cast him.

There's some among you have beheld me fighting:

Down with that sword! Tribunes
Lay hands upon him.

All will be naught else.
Get you gone.
Stand fast;
We have as many friends as enemies.

The gods forbid!
I prithee
Leave us to cure this cause.
For 'tis a sore upon us
Come
I would they were barbarians--as they are
Be gone;
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
One time will owe another.
On fair ground
I could beat forty of them.
I could myself
Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea
two tribunes:
But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
And manhood is call'd foolery
Against a falling fabric. Will you hence
Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
What they are used to bear.
Pray you
I'll try whether my old wit be in request
With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
With cloth of any colour.
Nay

He heard the name of death.
A noise within
Here's goodly work!
I would they were abed!
I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
Could he not speak 'em fair?
Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS
Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself?
You worthy tribunes
He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law
Than the severity of the public power
Which he so sets at nought.
He shall well know
The noble tribunes are the people's mouths
He shall
Sir
Peace!
Do not cry havoc
With modest warrant.
Sir
Have holp to make this rescue?
Hear me speak:
As I do know the consul's worthiness
Consul! what consul?
The consul Coriolanus.
He consul!
No
If
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time.
Speak briefly then;
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
Were but one danger
Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
He dies to-night.
Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome
Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
In Jove's own book
Should now eat up her own!
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O
Mortal
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies
Which
And what is left
This is clean kam.
Merely awry: when he did love his country
The service of the foot
Being once gangrened
For what before it was.
We'll hear no more.
Pursue him to his house
Lest his infection
One word more
This tiger-footed rage
The harm of unscann'd swiftness
Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
Lest parties
If it were so
What do ye talk?
Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
Since he could draw a sword
In bolted language; meal and bran together
He throws without distinction. Give me leave
Where he shall answer
Noble tribunes
Will prove too bloody
Unknown to the beginning.
Noble Menenius
Masters
Go not home.
Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
Where
In our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
To the Senators
Let me desire your company: he must come
Pray you
Exeunt
SCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.
Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians
Let them puff all about mine ears
Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels
Below the beam of sight
Be thus to them.
You do the nobler.
I muse my mother
Does not approve me further
To call them woollen vassals
To buy and sell with groats
In congregations
To speak of peace or war.
Enter VOLUMNIA
I talk of you:
Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
False to my nature? Rather say I play
The man I am.
O
Let go.
You might have been enough the man you are
The thwartings of your dispositions
You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
Let them hang.
Ay
Enter MENENIUS and Senators
Come
too rough;
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy;
Unless
Cleave in the midst
Pray
I have a heart as little apt as yours
To better vantage.
Well said
Before he should thus stoop to the herd
The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
For the whole state
What must I do?
Return to the tribunes.
Well
Repent what you have spoke.
For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?
You are too absolute;
Though therein you can never be too noble
Tush
A good demand.
If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not
With honour
It stands in like request?
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak
To the people; not by your own instruction
Your tongue
Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
Now
Than to take in a town with gentle words
The hazard of much blood.
I would dissemble with my nature where
My fortunes and my friends at stake required
I should do so in honour: I am in this
And you will rather show our general louts
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em
Of what that want might ruin.
Noble lady!
Come
Of what is past.
I prithee now
And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
Action is eloquence
More learned than the ears--waving thy head
That will not hold the handling: or say to them
Hast not the soft way which
Thyself
As thou hast power and person.
This but done
For they have pardons
As words to little purpose.
Prithee now
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
Enter COMINIUS
I have been i' the market-place; and
You make strong party
By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
Only fair speech.
I think 'twill serve
Can thereto frame his spirit.
He must
Prithee now
Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
A lie that it must bear? Well
Yet
And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
You have put me now to such a part which never
I shall discharge to the life.
Come
I prithee now
My praises made thee first a soldier
Thou hast not done before.
Well
Away
Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd
Small as an eunuch
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
Tent in my cheeks
The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
Make motion through my lips
That hath received an alms! I will not do't
And by my body's action teach my mind
A most inherent baseness.
At thy choice
To beg of thee
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
Thy valiantness was mine
Pray
Mother
Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves
Of all the trades in Rome. Look
Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
I' the way of flattery further.
Do your will.
Exit
Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
To answer mildly; for they are prepared
With accusations
Than are upon you yet.
The word is 'mildly.' Pray you
Let them accuse me by invention
Will answer in mine honour.
Ay
Well
Exeunt
SCENE III. The same. The Forum.
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
In this point charge him home
Tyrannical power: if he evade us there
Was ne'er distributed.
Enter an AEdile
What
He's coming.
How accompanied?
With old Menenius
That always favour'd him.
Have you a catalogue
Of all the voices that we have procured
Set down by the poll?
I have; 'tis ready.
Have you collected them by tribes?
I have.
Assemble presently the people hither;
And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
I' the right and strength o' the commons
For death
If I say fine
Insisting on the old prerogative
And power i' the truth o' the cause.
I shall inform them.
And when such time they have begun to cry
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence.
Very well.
Make them be strong and ready for this hint
Go about it.
Exit AEdile
Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
Ever to conquer
Of contradiction: being once chafed
Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
With us to break his neck.
Well
Enter CORIOLANUS
Calmly
Ay
Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
Keep Rome in safety
Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace
Amen
A noble wish.
Re-enter AEdile
Draw near
List to your tribunes. Audience: peace
First
Well
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
As shall be proved upon you?
I am content.
Lo
The warlike service he has done
Upon the wounds his body bears
Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers
Consider further
His rougher accents for malicious sounds
Well
What is the matter
That being pass'd for consul with full voice
You take it off again?
Answer to us.
Say
We charge you
From Rome all season'd office and to wind
Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people.
How! traitor!
Nay
The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
Thy lying tongue both numbers
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
As I do pray the gods.
Mark you this
To the rock
Peace!
We need not put new matter to his charge:
What you have seen him do and heard him speak
Those whose great power must try him; even this
But since he hath
Served well for Rome
What do you prate of service?
I talk of that
You?
Is this the promise that you made your mother?
Know
I know no further:
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death
But with a grain a day
Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
Nor cheque my courage for what they can give
For that he has
Envied against the people
To pluck away their power
Given hostile strokes
Of dreaded justice
That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
And in the power of us the tribunes
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name
It shall be so
He's banish'd
Hear me
He's sentenced; no more hearing.
Let me speak:
I have been consul
Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
My country's good with a respect more tender
Speak that
We know your drift: speak what?
There's no more to be said
It shall be so.
It shall be so
You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
As reek o' the rotten fens
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
That do corrupt my air
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies
To banish your defenders; till at length
Your ignorance
Abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows! Despising
There is a world elsewhere.
Exeunt CORIOLANUS
The people's enemy is gone
Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
Shouting
Go
Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
Attend us through the city.
Come
The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.
Enter CORIOLANUS
Come
With many heads butts me away. Nay
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
That common chances common men could bear;
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
With precepts that would make invincible
The heart that conn'd them.
O heavens! O heavens!
Nay! prithee
Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome
What
I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay
Resume that spirit
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius
I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
My hazards still have been your solace: and
Believe't not lightly--though I go alone
Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
Will or exceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practise.
My first son.
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
With thee awhile: determine on some course
That starts i' the way before thee.
O the gods!
I'll follow thee a month
Where thou shalt rest
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal
O'er the vast world to seek a single man
I' the absence of the needer.
Fare ye well:
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
Of the wars' surfeits
That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
Come
My friends of noble touch
While I remain above the ground
Hear from me still
But what is like me formerly.
That's worthily
As any ear can hear. Come
If I could shake off but one seven years
From these old arms and legs
Give me thy hand: Come.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same. A  street near the gate.
Enter SICINIUS
Bid them all home; he's gone
The nobility are vex'd
In his behalf.
Now we have shown our power
Than when it was a-doing.
Bid them home:
Say their great enemy is gone
Stand in their ancient strength.
Dismiss them home.
Exit AEdile
Here comes his mother.
Let's not meet her.
Why?
They say she's mad.
They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
Enter VOLUMNIA
O
Requite your love!
Peace
If that I could for weeping
Nay
To BRUTUS
Will you be gone?
[To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too: I would I had the power
To say so to my husband.
Are  you mankind?
Ay
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?
O blessed heavens!
More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
Nay
Were in Arabia
What then?
What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
Bastards and all.
Good man
Come
I would he had continued to his country
As he began
The noble knot he made.
I would he had.
'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
Cats
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know.
Pray
Now
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rome
This lady's husband here
Whom you have banish'd
Well
Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits?
Take my prayers with you.
Exeunt Tribunes
I would the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
But once a-day
Of what lies heavy to't.
You have told them home;
And
Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do
Fie
Exeunt
SCENE III. A highway between Rome and Antium.
Enter a Roman and a Volsce
I know you well
me: your name
It is so
I am a Roman; and my services are
Nicanor? no.
The same
You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state
day's journey.
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
people against the senators
Hath been! is it ended
so: they are in a most warlike preparation
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
The main blaze of it is past
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus
all power from the people and to pluck from them
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing
tell you
breaking out.
Coriolanus banished!
Banished
You will be welcome with this intelligence
The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
said
when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars
great opposer
of his country.
He cannot choose. I am most fortunate
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
business
I shall
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
their adversaries. Have you an army ready
A most royal one; the centurions and their charges
I am joyful to hear of their readiness
man
So
You take my part from me
to be glad of yours.
Well
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius's house.
Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel
A goodly city is this Antium. City
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not
In puny battle slay me.
Enter a Citizen
Save you
And you.
Direct me
He is
At his house this night.
Which is his house
This
Thank you
Exit Citizen
O world
Unseparable
To bitterest enmity: so
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I
This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me
Exit
SCENE V. The same. A hall in Aufidius's house.
Music within. Enter a Servingman
Wine
is here! I think our fellows are asleep.

Enter a second Servingman
Where's Cotus? my master calls
for him. Cotus!
Exit
Enter CORIOLANUS
A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
Appear not like a guest.
Re-enter the first Servingman
What would you have
Here's no place for you: pray
Exit
I have deserved no better entertainment
Re-enter second Servingman
Whence are you

Pray
Away!
Away! get you away.
Now thou'rt troublesome.
Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him
What fellow's this?
A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
out of the house: prithee
Retires
What have you to do here

Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
What are you?
A gentleman.
A marvellous poor one.
TRUE
Pray you

Follow your function
Pushes him away
What
strange guest he has here.
And I shall.
Exit
Where dwellest thou?
Under the canopy.
Under the canopy!
Ay.
Where's that?
I' the city of kites and crows.
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?
No
How
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest
trencher
Beats him away. Exit third Servingman
Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman
Where is this fellow?
Here
disturbing the lords within.
Retires
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak
If
Not yet thou knowest me
Think me for the man I am
Commands me name myself.
What is thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears
Say
Thou hast a grim appearance
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
thou me yet?
I know thee not: thy name?
My name is Caius Marcius
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people
Have all forsook me
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
Mistake me not--to save my life
I had fear'd death
I would have 'voided thee
A heart of wreak in thee
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country
thee straight
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou'rt tired
Longer to live most weary
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool
It be to do thee service.
O Marcius
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things
Than thee
Mine arms about that body
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
Twelve several times
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in my sleep
Thou art thence banish'd
From twelve to seventy
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome
Who now are here
You bless me
Therefore
The leading of thine own revenges
The one half of my commission; and set down--
As best thou art experienced
Thy country's strength and weakness
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward
Here's a strange alteration!
By my hand
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him.
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb
Nay
him: he had
cannot tell how to term it.
He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged
So did I
man i' the world.
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
Who
Nay
Worth six on him.
Nay
greater soldier.
Faith
for the defence of a town
Ay
Re-enter third Servingman
O slaves
What
I would not be a Roman
lieve be a condemned man.
Wherefore? wherefore?
Why
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
good enough for him.
Come
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
He was too hard for him directly
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado.
An he had been cannibally given
broiled and eaten him too.
But
Why
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
question asked him by any of the senators
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday; for the other has half
and grant of the whole table. He'll go
will mow all down before him
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
Do't! he will do't; for
many friends as enemies; which friends
were
we term it
Directitude! what's that?
But when they shall see
burrows
him.
But when goes this forward?
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis
parcel of their feast
wipe their lips.
Why
This peace is nothing
tailors
Let me have war
day does night; it's spritely
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy
mulled
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
'Tis so: and as war
be a ravisher
great maker of cuckolds.
Ay
Reason; because they then less need one another.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They are rising
In
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
We hear not of him
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
And quietness of the people
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.
We stood to't in good time.
Enter MENENIUS
Is this Menenius?
'Tis he
Hail sir!
Hail to you both!
Your Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd
The commonwealth doth stand
All's well; and might have been much better
He could have temporized.
Where is he
Nay
Hear nothing from him.
Enter three or four Citizens
The gods preserve you both!
God-den
God-den to you all
Ourselves
Live
Farewell
Had loved you as we did.
Now the gods keep you!
Farewell
Exeunt Citizens
This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent
And affecting one sole throne
I think not so.
We should by this
The gods have well prevented it
Sits safe and still without him.
Enter an AEdile
Worthy tribunes
Are enter'd in the Roman territories
Destroy what lies before 'em.
'Tis Aufidius
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome
Come
Of Marcius?
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can
Within my age. But reason with the fellow
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.
Tell not me:
I know this cannot be.
Not possible.
Enter a Messenger
The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their countenances.
'Tis this slave;--
Go whip him
Nothing but his report.
Yes
What more fearful?
It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
How probable I do not know--that Marcius
The young'st and oldest thing.
This is most likely!
Raised only
Good Marcius home again.
The very trick on't.
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.
Enter a second Messenger
You are sent for to the senate:
A fearful army
Associated with Aufidius
Upon our territories; and have already
O'erborne their way
What lay before them.
Enter COMINIUS
O
What news? what news?
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates
What's the news? what's the news?
Your temples burned in their cement
Your franchises
Into an auger's bore.
Pray now
You have made fair work
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians
If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than nature
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies
You have made good work
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of garlic-eaters!
He will shake
Your Rome about your ears.
As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!
But is this true
Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance
Your enemies and his find something in him.
We are all undone
The noble man have mercy.
Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends
Should say 'Be good to Rome
As those should do that had deserved his hate
'Tis true:
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it
To say 'Beseech you
You have brought
A trembling upon Rome
So incapable of help.
Say not we brought it.
How! Was it we? we loved him but
And cowardly nobles
But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the policy
Enter a troop of Citizens
Here come the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
That made the air unwholesome
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down
if he could burn us all into one coal
Faith
For mine own part
And so did I.
And so did I; and
many of us: that we did
though we willingly consented to his banishment
it was against our will.
Ye re goodly things
You have made
Good work
O
Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
Go
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home
The gods be good to us! Come
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
him.
So did we all. But
Exeunt Citizens
I do not like this news.
Nor I.
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!
Pray
Exeunt
SCENE VII. A camp
Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him
Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat
And you are darken'd in this action
I cannot help it now
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
What cannot be amended.
Yet I wish
I mean for your particular
Join'd in commission with him; but either
Had borne the action of yourself
To him had left it solely.
I understand thee well; and be thou sure
What I can urge against him. Although it seems
To the vulgar eye
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
Sir
All places yield to him ere he sits down;
And the nobility of Rome are his:
The senators and patricians love him too:
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal
To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
As is the osprey to the fish
By sovereignty of nature. First he was
A noble servant to them; but he could not
Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride
The happy man; whether defect of judgment
Which he was lord of; or whether nature
From the casque to the cushion
Even with the same austerity and garb
As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
As he hath spices of them all
Lie in the interpretation of the time:
And power
To extol what it hath done.
One fire drives out one fire; one nail
Rights by rights falter
Come
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.
Enter MENENIUS
No
Which was sometime his general; who loved him
In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
But what o' that? Go
A mile before his tent fall down
The way into his mercy: nay
To hear Cominius speak
He would not seem to know me.
Do you hear?
Yet one time he did call me by my name:
I urged our old acquaintance
That we have bled together. Coriolanus
He would not answer to: forbad all names;
He was a kind of nothing
Of burning Rome.
Why
A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome
I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
When it was less expected: he replied
To one whom they had punish'd.
Very well:
Could he say less?
I offer'd to awaken his regard
For's private friends: his answer to me was
Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly
For one poor grain or two!
I am one of those; his mother
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
Nay
In this so never-needed help
Upbraid's with our distress. But
Would be your country's pleader
No
Pray you
What should I do?
Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome
Well
Return me
But as a discontented friend
With his unkindness? say't be so?
Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome
As you intended well.
I'll undertake 't:
I think he'll hear me. Yet
And hum at good Cominius
He was not taken well; he had not dined:
The veins unfill'd
We pout upon the morning
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
These and these conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
Till he be dieted to my request
You know the very road into his kindness
Good faith
Of my success.
Exit
He'll never hear him.
Not?
I tell you
Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
Thus
So that all hope is vain.
Unless his noble mother
Who
For mercy to his country. Therefore
Exeunt
SCENE II. Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.
Two Sentinels on guard.
Enter to them
Stay: whence are you?
Stand
You guard like men; 'tis well: but
To speak with Coriolanus.
From whence?
From Rome.
You may not pass
Will no more hear from thence.
You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
You'll speak with Coriolanus.
Good my friends
Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
Is not here passable.
I tell thee
The book of his good acts
His name unparallel'd
For I have ever verified my friends
Would without lapsing suffer: nay
Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore
Faith
behalf as you have uttered words in your own
should not pass here; no
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore
Prithee
Howsoever you have been his liar
have
say
Has he dined
speak with him till after dinner.
You are a Roman
I am
Then you should hate Rome
defender of them
ignorance
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in
such weak breath as this? No
therefore
execution: you are condemned
you out of reprieve and pardon.
Sirrah
use me with estimation.
Come
I mean
My general cares not for you. Back
I let forth your half-pint of blood; back
the utmost of your having: back.
Nay
Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
What's the matter?
Now
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus: guess
with him
hanging
spectatorship
presently
To CORIOLANUS
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity
thy old father Menenius does! O my son
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
thee; but being assured none but myself could move
thee
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
wrath
here
access to thee.
Away!
How! away!
Wife
Are servanted to others: though I owe
My revenge properly
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar
Than pity note how much. Therefore
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
Your gates against my force. Yet
Gives a letter
And would have rent it. Another word
You keep a constant temper.
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
Now
'Tis a spell
way home again.
Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back?
What cause
I neither care for the world nor your general: for
such things as you
himself fears it not from another: let your general
do his worst. For you
your misery increase with your age! I say to you
Exit
A noble fellow
The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock
oak not to be wind-shaken.
Exeunt
SCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus.
Enter CORIOLANUS
We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
Set down our host. My partner in this action
I have borne this business.
Only their ends
You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
The general suit of Rome; never admitted
A private whisper
That thought them sure of you.
This last old man
Nay
Was to send him; for whose old love I have
The first conditions
And cannot now accept; to grace him only
That thought he could do more
I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits
Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
Shout within
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
Enter in mourning habits
My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
Wherein this trunk was framed
The grandchild to her blood. But
All bond and privilege of nature
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes
Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod: and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession
Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
Be such a gosling to obey instinct
And knew no other kin.
My lord and husband!
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
Makes you think so.
Like a dull actor now
For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O
Long as my exile
Now
I carried from thee
Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate
Leave unsaluted: sink
Kneels
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons.
O
Whilst
Show duty
Between the child and parent.
Kneels
What is this?
Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
Murdering impossibility
What cannot be
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
The noble sister of Publicola
That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
This is a poor epitome of yours
May show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers
Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
To shame unvulnerable
Like a great sea-mark
Your knee
That's my brave boy!
Even he
I beseech you
Or
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers
Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
To ally my rages and revenges with
Your colder reasons.
O
You have said you will not grant us any thing;
For we have nothing else to ask
Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
That
May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
Aufidius
Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither: since that thy sight
Make our eyes flow with joy
with comforts
Making the mother
The son
His country's bowels out. And to poor we
Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
Our prayers to the gods
That all but we enjoy; for how can we
Whereto we are bound
The country
An evident calamity
Our wish
Must
With manacles thorough our streets
triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin
Thy wife and children's blood. For myself
These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of one
March to assault thy country than to tread--
Trust to't
Ay
Living to time.
A' shall not tread on me;
I'll run away till I am bigger
Not of a woman's tenderness to be
I have sat too long.
Rising
Nay
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans
The Volsces whom you serve
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans
Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
For making up this peace!' Thou know'st
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble
Destroy'd his country
To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy
To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
Down
To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
This is the last: so we will home to Rome
This boy
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship
Than thou hast to deny 't. Come
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire
He holds her by the hand
O mother
What have you done? Behold
They laugh at. O my mother
You have won a happy victory to Rome;
But
Aufidius
A mother less? or granted less
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were:
And
Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But
[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
thy honour
At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
Myself a former fortune.
The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS
Ay
To VOLUMNIA
But we will drink together; and you shall bear
A better witness back than words
Come
To have a temple built you: all the swords
In Italy
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Rome. A public place.
Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS
See you yond coign o' the Capitol
corner-stone?
Why
If it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger
Rome
But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution.
Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man!
There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
creeping thing.
He loved his mother dearly.
So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks
moves like an engine
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye; talks like a knell
battery. He sits in his state
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in.
Yes
I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
you.
The gods be good unto us!
No
us. When we banished him
and
Enter a Messenger
Sir
The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
And hale him up and down
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home
Enter a second Messenger
What's the news?
Good news
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome
Friend
As certain as I know the sun is fire:
Where have you lurk'd
Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide
Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together
The trumpets
A shout within
This is good news:
I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
Is worth of consuls
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
I'd not have given a doit. Hark
Music still
First
Sir
Great cause to give great thanks.
They are near the city?
Almost at point to enter.
We will meet them
Exeunt
SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.
Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA
Behold our patroness
Call all your tribes together
Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius
Cry 'Welcome
Welcome
A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt
SCENE VI. Antium. A public place.
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS
Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
Deliver them this paper: having read it
The city ports by this hath enter'd and
Intends to appear before the people
To purge herself with words: dispatch.
Exeunt Attendants
Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction
Most welcome!
How is it with our general?
Even so
As with a man by his own alms empoison'd
Most noble sir
You wish'd us parties
Of your great danger.
Sir
We must proceed as we do find the people.
The people will remain uncertain whilst
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
Makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it;
And my pretext to strike at him admits
A good construction. I raised him
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd
But to be rough
Sir
When he did stand for consul
By lack of stooping
That I would have spoke of:
Being banish'd for't
Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
In all his own desires; nay
Out of my files
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his; and took some pride
To do myself this wrong: till
He waged me with his countenance
I had been mercenary.
So he did
The army marvell'd at it
For no less spoil than glory
There was it:
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum
As cheap as lies
Of our great action: therefore shall he die
Drums and trumpets sound
Your native town you enter'd like a post
And patient fools
With giving him glory.
Therefore
With what he would say
His reasons with his body.
Say no more:
Here come the lords.
Enter the Lords of the city
You are most welcome home.
I have not deserved it.
But
What I have written to you?
We have.
And grieve to hear't.
What faults he made before the last
Might have found easy fines: but there to end
Where he was to begin and give away
The benefit of our levies
With our own charge
There was a yielding
He approaches: you shall hear him.
Enter CORIOLANUS
Hail
Than when I parted hence
Under your great command. You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
Do more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action. We have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiates
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver
We have compounded on.
Read it not
But tell the traitor
He hath abused your powers.
Traitor! how now!
Ay
Marcius!
Ay
I'll grace thee with that robbery
Coriolanus in Corioli?
You lords and heads o' the state
He has betray'd your business
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk
Counsel o' the war
He whined and roar'd away your victory
Look'd wondering each at other.
Hear'st thou
Name not the god
Ha!
No more.
Measureless liar
Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
Pardon me
I was forced to scold. Your judgments
Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
To thrust the lie unto him.
Peace
Cut me to pieces
If you have writ your annals true
Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it. Boy!
Why
Let him die for't.
'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
Peace
The man is noble and his fame folds-in
This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
Shall have judicious hearing. Stand
O that I had him
Insolent villain!
Kill
The Conspirators draw
Hold
My noble masters
O Tullus
Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
Tread not upon him. Masters all
Put up your swords.
My lords
Which this man's life did owe you
That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
To call me to your senate
Myself your loyal servant
Your heaviest censure.
Bear from hence his body;
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
As the most noble corse that ever herald
Did follow to his urn.
His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
Let's make the best of it.
My rage is gone;
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
Help
Beat thou the drum
Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.
Enter two Gentlemen
You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Still seem as does the king.
But what's the matter?
His daughter
He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
That late he married--hath referr'd herself
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
Be touch'd at very heart.
None but the king?
He that hath lost her too; so is the queen
Of the king's look's
Glad at the thing they scowl at.
And why so?
He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
I mean
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
As
For one his like
In him that should compare. I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he.
You speak him far.
I do extend him
His measure duly.
What's his name and birth?
I cannot delve him to the root: his father
Was call'd Sicilius
Against the Romans with Cassibelan
He served with glory and admired success
And had
Died with their swords in hand; for which
their father
That he quit being
As he was born. The king he takes the babe
To his protection
Could make him the receiver of; which he took
Which rare it is to do--most praised
A glass that feated them
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is.
I honour him
Even out of your report. But
His only child.
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing
Were stol'n
Which way they went.
How long is this ago?
Some twenty years.
That a king's children should be so convey'd
Howsoe'er 'tis strange
I do well believe you.
We must forbear: here comes the gentleman
Exeunt
Enter the QUEEN
No
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
That lock up your restraint. For you
The fire of rage is in him
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
Your wisdom may inform you.
Please your highness
You know the peril.
I'll fetch a turn about the garden
The pangs of barr'd affections
Hath charged you should not speak together.
Exit
O
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband
Always reserved my holy duty--what
His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes
That I may see again.
My queen! my mistress!
O lady
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man. I will remain
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
My residence in Rome at one Philario's
Known but by letter: thither write
Re-enter QUEEN
Be brief
If the king come
How much of his displeasure.
Aside
Yet I'll move him
To walk this way: I never do him wrong
Pays dear for my offences.
Exit
Should we be taking leave
As long a term as yet we have to live
Nay
Were you but riding forth to air yourself
This diamond was my mother's: take it
But keep it till you woo another wife
How
You gentle gods
With bonds of death!
Putting on the ring
Remain
While sense can keep it on. And
I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
Upon this fairest prisoner.
Putting a bracelet upon her arm
O the gods!
When shall we see again?
Enter CYMBELINE and Lords
Alack
Thou basest thing
If after this command thou fraught the court
With thy unworthiness
Thou'rt poison to my blood.
The gods protect you!
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.
Exit
There cannot be a pinch in death
More sharp than this is.
O disloyal thing
A year's age on me.
I beseech you
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
Subdues all pangs
Past grace? obedience?
Past hope
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
O blest
Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
A seat for baseness.
No; I rather added
A lustre to it.
O thou vile one!
Sir
You bred him as my playfellow
A man worth any woman
Almost the sum he pays.
What
Almost
A neat-herd's daughter
Our neighbour shepherd's son!
Thou foolish thing!
Re-enter QUEEN
They were again together: you have done
Not after our command. Away with her
Beseech your patience. Peace
Out of your best advice.
Nay
A drop of blood a day; and
Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords
Fie! you must give way.
Enter PISANIO
Here is your servant. How now
My lord your son drew on my master.
Ha!
No harm
There might have been
And had no help of anger: they were parted
By gentlemen at hand.
I am very glad on't.
Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
I would they were in Afric both together;
Myself by with a needle
The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
On his command: he would not suffer me
To bring him to the haven; left these notes
Of what commands I should be subject to
This hath been
Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
He will remain so.
I humbly thank your highness.
Pray
About some half-hour hence
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same. A public place.
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
Sir
violence of action hath made you reek as a
sacrifice: where air comes out
there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
If my shirt were bloody
[Aside]  No
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel
[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' the
backside the town.
The villain would not stand me.
[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still
Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
he added to your having; gave you some ground.
[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
I would they had not come between us.
[Aside]  So would I
a fool you were upon the ground.
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election
is damned.
Sir
go not together: she's a good sign
small reflection of her wit.
[Aside]  She shines not upon fools
reflection should hurt her.
Come
hurt done!
[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
of an ass
You'll go with us?
I'll attend your lordship.
Nay
Well
Exeunt
SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven
And not have it
That he spake to thee?
It was his queen
Then waved his handkerchief?
And kiss'd it
Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
And that was all?
No
As he could make me with this eye or ear
Distinguish him from others
The deck
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on
Thou shouldst have made him
As little as a crow
To after-eye him.
Madam
I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them
To look upon him
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
The smallness of a gnat to air
Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But
Be assured
I did not take my leave of him
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
How I would think on him at certain hours
Such thoughts and such
The shes of Italy should not betray
Mine interest and his honour
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Betwixt two charming words
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Shakes all our buds from growing.
Enter a Lady
The queen
Those things I bid you do
I will attend the queen.
Madam
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.
Enter PHILARIO
Believe it
then of a crescent note
as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I
could then have looked on him without the help of
admiration
had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
he is with that which makes him both without and within.
I have seen him in France: we had very many there
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
This matter of marrying his king's daughter
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own
And then his banishment.
Ay
lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment
taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
acquaintance?
His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I
have been often bound for no less than my life.
Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
amongst you as suits
knowing
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
I beseech you all
gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
hereafter
Sir
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies
Sir
did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
you should have been put together with so mortal a
purpose as then each bore
slight and trivial a nature.
By your pardon
rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
'Faith
confounded one the other
Can we
Safely
It was much like an argument that fell out last
night
country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
affirmation--his to be more fair
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
That lady is not now living
opinion by this worn out.
She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
Being so far provoked as I was in France
abate her nothing
adorer
As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
comparison--had been something too fair and too good
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
I have seen
many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
excelled many: but I have not seen the most
precious diamond that is
I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
What do you esteem it at?
More than the world enjoys.
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead
outprized by a trifle.
You are mistaken: the one may be sold
there were wealth enough for the purchase
for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale
Which the gods have given you?
Which
You may wear her in title yours: but
ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
estimations; the one is but frail and the other
casual; a cunning thief
courtier
Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
to convince the honour of my mistress
holding or loss of that
nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
notwithstanding
Let us leave here
Sir
thank him
With five times so much conversation
ground of your fair mistress
to the yielding
No
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
your ring; which
something: but I make my wager rather against your
confidence than her reputation: and
offence herein too
lady in the world.
You are a great deal abused in too bold a
persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're
worthy of by your attempt.
What's that?
A repulse: though your attempt
Gentlemen
let it die as it was born
better acquainted.
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
approbation of what I have spoke!
What lady would you choose to assail?
Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring
second conference
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
I will wage against your gold
I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
You are afraid
ladies' flesh at a million a dram
preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
religion in you
This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a
graver purpose
I am the master of my speeches
what's spoken
Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
I will have it no lay.
By the gods
sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
bodily part of your mistress
are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off
yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
free entertainment.
I embrace these conditions; let us have articles
betwixt us. Only
you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
to understand you have prevailed
your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she
remain unseduced
otherwise
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
your sword.
Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set
down by lawful counsel

wagers recorded.
Agreed.

Whiles yet the dew's on ground

Dispatch.
Exeunt Ladies
Now
Pleaseth your highness
Presenting a small box
But I beseech your grace
My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds
But though slow
I wonder
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea
That our great king himself doth woo me oft
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded
Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
That I did amplify my judgment in
Other conclusions? I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
We count not worth the hanging
Allayments to their act
Their several virtues and effects.
Your highness
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:
Besides
Both noisome and infectious.
O
Enter PISANIO
Aside
Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
Will I first work: he's for his master
Doctor
Take your own way.
[Aside]          I do suspect you
But you shall do no harm.
[To PISANIO]            Hark thee
[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has
Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
Which first
cats and dogs
No danger in what show of death it makes
With a most false effect; and I the truer
No further service
I humbly take my leave.
Exit
Weeps she still
She will not quench and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
As great as is thy master
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
Is at last gasp: return he cannot
Continue where he is: to shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up
Thou takest up
Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:
It is a thing I made
Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know
What is more cordial. Nay
It is an earnest of a further good
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
Think what a chance thou changest on
Thou hast thy mistress still
To any shape of thy preferment such
As thou'lt desire; and then myself
To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
Think on my words.
Exit PISANIO
A sly and constant knave
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
Which
Of liegers for her sweet
To taste of too.

Madam
Change you
The worthy Leonatus is in safety
And greets your highness dearly.
Presents a letter
Thanks
You're kindly welcome.
[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!
If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare
Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
Arm me
Or
Rather directly fly.
[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
him accordingly

So far I read aloud:
But even the very middle of my heart
Is warm'd by the rest
You are as welcome
Have words to bid you
In all that I can do.
Thanks
What
To see this vaulted arch
Of sea and land
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
Partition make with spectacles so precious
'Twixt fair and foul?
What makes your admiration?
It cannot be i' the eye
'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment
Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
Should make desire vomit emptiness
What is the matter
The cloyed will
Both fill'd and running
Longs after for the garbage.

To PISANIO
Beseech you
My man's abode where I did leave him: he
Is strange and peevish.
I was going
Exit
Continues well my lord? His health
Well
Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
The Briton reveller.
When he was here
Not knowing why.
I never saw him sad.
There is a Frenchman his companion
An eminent monsieur
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
The thick sighs from him
Your lord
By history
But must be
Assured bondage?'
Will my lord say so?
Ay
It is a recreation to be by
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But
Not he
Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
Be used more thankfully. In himself
In you
To pity too.
What do you pity
Two creatures heartily.
Am I one
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity?
Lamentable! What
I' the dungeon by a snuff?
I pray you
To my demands. Why do you pity me?
That others do--
I was about to say--enjoy your--But
It is an office of the gods to venge it
You do seem to know
Something of me
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do; for certainties
Either are past remedies
What both you spur and stop.
Had I this cheek
To bathe my lips upon; this hand
To the oath of loyalty; this object
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
That all the plagues of hell should at one time
Encounter such revolt.
My lord
And himself. Not I
The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out.
Let me hear no more.
O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
With pity
So fair
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
That play with all infirmities for gold
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
Or she that bore you was no queen
Recoil from your great stock.
Revenged!
How should I be revenged? If this be true
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
Must not in haste abuse--if it be true
Should he make me
Live
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
What
Let me my service tender on your lips.
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable
For such an end thou seek'st
Thou wrong'st a gentleman
From thy report as thou from honour
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
Thee and the devil alike. What ho
The king my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit
As in a Romish stew and to expound
His beastly mind to us
He little cares for and a daughter who
He not respects at all. What
O happy Leonatus! I may say
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Deserves thy trust
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
Country call'd his! and you his mistress
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
I have spoke this
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord
The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
That he enchants societies into him;
Half all men's hearts are his.
You make amends.
He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
He hath a kind of honour sets him off
To try your taking a false report; which hath
Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
In the election of a sir so rare
Made me to fan you thus
All's well
for yours.
My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
To entreat your grace but in a small request
Your lord; myself and other noble friends
Pray
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
To buy a present for the emperor
Which I
In France: 'tis plate of rare device
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
And I am something curious
To take them in protection?
Willingly;
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
My lord hath interest in them
In my bedchamber.
They are in a trunk
To send them to you
I must aboard to-morrow.
O
Yes
By lengthening my return. From Gallia
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
To see your grace.
I thank you for your pains:
But not away to-morrow!
O
Therefore I shall beseech you
To greet your lord with writing
I have outstood my time; which is material
To the tender of our present.
I will write.
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept

ACT II
SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.
Enter CLOTEN and two Lords
Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the
jack
hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine
oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
your bowl.
[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it
When a gentleman is disposed to swear
any standers-by to curtail his oaths
No my lord;
Aside
nor crop the ears of them.
Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
Would he had been one of my rank!
[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.
I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a
pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;
they dare not fight with me
mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of
fighting
nobody can match.
[Aside]  You are cock and capon too; and you crow
Sayest thou?
It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
companion that you give offence to.
No
offence to my inferiors.
Ay
Why
Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
A stranger
[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself
not.
There's an Italian come; and
Leonatus' friends.
Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another
One of your lordship's pages.
Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
derogation in't?
You cannot derogate
Not easily
[Aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore your
issues
Come
to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come
I'll attend your lordship.
Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord
That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
Cannot take two from twenty
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of thy dear husband
Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm
The walls of thy dear honour
That temple

SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:
a trunk in one corner of it.
IMOGEN in bed
Who's there? my woman Helen?
Please you
What hour is it?
Almost midnight
I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
Take not away the taper
And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock
Exit Lady
To your protection I commend me
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me
Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk
The crickets sing
Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
Did softly press the rushes
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
Bows toward her
Under these windows
With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design
Such and such pictures; there the window; such
The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures
Ah
Would testify
O sleep
And be her sense but as a monument
Taking off her bracelet
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly
A mole cinque-spotted
I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher
Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
Why should I write this down
The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
To the trunk again
Swift
May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
Though this a heavenly angel
Clock strikes
One
Goes into the trunk. The scene closes
An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.
Enter CLOTEN and Lords
Your lordship is the most patient man in loss
most coldest that ever turned up ace.
It would make any man cold to lose.
But not every man patient after the noble temper of
your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
Winning will put any man into courage. If I could
get this foolish Imogen
It's almost morning
Day
I would this music would come: I am advised to give
her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.
Enter Musicians
Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your
fingering
will do
First
after
words to it: and then let her consider.
SONG
Hark
On chaliced flowers that lies;
And winking Mary-buds begin
To ope their golden eyes:
With every thing that pretty is
Arise
So
consider your music the better: if it do not
a vice in her ears

Exeunt Musicians
Here comes the king.
I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I
was up so early: he cannot choose but take this
service I have done fatherly.
Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.
Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
Will she not forth?
I have assailed her with music
The exile of her minion is too new;
She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
Must wear the print of his remembrance out
You are most bound to the king
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
To orderly soliciting
With aptness of the season; make denials
Increase your services; so seem as if
You were inspired to do those duties which
You tender to her; that you in all obey her
Senseless! not so.
Enter a Messenger
So like you
The one is Caius Lucius.
A worthy fellow
But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
According to the honour of his sender;
And towards himself
To employ you towards this Roman. Come
Exeunt all but CLOTEN
If she be up
Knocks
By your leave
I Know her women are about her: what
If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea
Diana's rangers false themselves
Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold
Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
Nay
Can it not do and undo? I will make
One of her women lawyer to me
I yet not understand the case myself.
Knocks
By your leave.
Enter a Lady
Who's there that knocks?
A gentleman.
No more?
Yes
That's more
Than some
Your lady's person: is she ready?
Ay
There is gold for you;
Sell me your good report.
How! my good name? or to report of you
What I shall think is good?--The princess!
Enter IMOGEN
Good morrow
Exit Lady
Good morrow
For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
And scarce can spare them.
Still
If you but said so
If you swear still
That I regard it not.
This is no answer.
But that you shall not say I yield being silent
To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
Should learn
To leave you in your madness
I will not.
Fools are not mad folks.
Do you call me fool?
As I am mad
If you'll be patient
That cures us both. I am much sorry
To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather
You felt than make't my boast.
You sin against
Obedience
The contract you pretend with that base wretch
And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--
Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls
But brats and beggary
Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
The consequence o' the crown
The precious note of it with a base slave.
A hilding for a livery
Profane fellow
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
But what thou art besides
To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough
Comparative for your virtues
The under-hangman of his kingdom
For being preferred so well.
The south-fog rot him!
He never can meet more mischance than come
To be but named of thee. His meanest garment
In my respect than all the hairs above thee
Enter PISANIO
'His garment!' Now the devil--
To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--
'His garment!'
I am sprited with a fool.
Frighted
Search for a jewel that too casually
Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me
Of any king's in Europe. I do think
I saw't this morning: confident I am
Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he.
'Twill not be lost.
I hope so: go and search.
Exit PISANIO
You have abused me:
'His meanest garment!'
Ay
If you will make't an action
I will inform your father.
Your mother too:
She's my good lady
Exit
I'll be revenged:
'His meanest garment!' Well.

Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO
Fear it not
To win the king as I am bold her honour
Will remain hers.
What means do you make to him?
Not any
That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes
Your very goodness and your company
O'erpays all I can do. By this
Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius
Will do's commission throughly: and I think
He'll grant the tribute
Is yet fresh in their grief.
I do believe
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
Smiled at their lack of skill
their courage
Worthy his frowning at: their discipline
To their approvers they are people such
That mend upon the world.
Enter IACHIMO
See! Iachimo!
The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails
Welcome
I hope the briefness of your answer made
The speediness of your return.
Your lady
Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
Look through a casement to allure false hearts
And be false with them.
Here are letters for you.
Their tenor good
'Tis very like.
Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there?
He was expected then
All is well yet.
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
Too dull for your good wearing?
If I had lost it
I'll make a journey twice as far
A second night of such sweet shortness which
Was mine in Britain
The stone's too hard to come by.
Not a whit
Make not
Must not continue friends.
Good sir
The knowledge of your mistress home
We were to question further: but I now
Profess myself the winner of her honour
Of her or you
By both your wills.
If you can make't apparent
That you have tasted her in bed
And ring is yours; if not
You had of her pure honour gains or loses
Your sword or mine
To who shall find them.
Sir
I will confirm with oath; which
You need it not.
Proceed.
First
Where
Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd
With tapesty of silk and silver; the story
Proud Cleopatra
The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
So bravely done
In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought
This is true;
And this you might have heard of here
More particulars
Must justify my knowledge.
So they must
The chimney
Is south the chamber
Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
So likely to report themselves: the cutter
Was as another nature
This is a thing
Which you might from relation likewise reap
The roof o' the chamber
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
Of silver
Depending on their brands.
This is her honour!
Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
Be given to your remembrance--the description
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
The wager you have laid.
Then
Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!
And now 'tis up again: it must be married
To that your diamond; I'll keep them.
Jove!
Once more let me behold it: is it that
Which I left with her?
Sir--I thank her--that:
She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
Her pretty action did outsell her gift
She prized it once.
May be she pluck'd it off
To send it me.
She writes so to you
O
Gives the ring
It is a basilisk unto mine eye
Where there is beauty; truth
Of no more bondage be
O
Have patience
It may be probable she lost it; or
Who knows if one of her women
Very true;
And so
Render to me some corporal sign about her
By Jupiter
Hark you
'Tis true:--nay
She would not lose it: her attendants are
All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
And by a stranger!--No
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
thus dearly.
There
Divide themselves between you!
Sir
This is not strong enough to be believed
Of one persuaded well of--
Never talk on't;
She hath been colted by him.
If you seek
For further satisfying
Worthy the pressing--lies a mole
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life
To feed again
This stain upon her?
Ay
Another stain
Will you hear more?
Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;
Once
I'll be sworn--
No swearing.
If you will swear you have not done't
And I will kill thee
Thou'st made me cuckold.
I'll deny nothing.
O
I will go there and do't
Her father. I'll do something--
Exit
Quite besides
The government of patience! You have won:
Let's follow him
He hath against himself.
With an my heart.
Exeunt

Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Is there no way for men to be but women
Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;
And that most venerable man which I
Did call my father
When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools
Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd
The Dian of that time so doth my wife
The nonpareil of this. O
Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O
This yellow Iachimo
Or less
But what he look'd for should oppose and she
Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
That tends to vice in man
It is the woman's part: be it lying
Lust and rank thoughts
Ambitions
For even to vice
They are not constant but are changing still
One vice
Not half so old as that. I'll write against them
In a true hate
The very devils cannot plague them better.

ACT III
SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.
Enter in state
Now say
When Julius Caesar
Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
Be theme and hearing ever
And conquer'd it
Famous in Caesar's praises
Than in his feats deserving it--for him
And his succession granted Rome a tribute
Is left untender'd.
And
There be many Caesars
A world by itself; and we will nothing pay
For wearing our own noses.
That opportunity
Which then they had to take from 's
We have again. Remember
The natural bravery of your isle
As Neptune's park
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
From off our coast
Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
The famed Cassibelan
O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword
And Britons strut with courage.
Come
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and
them may have crook'd noses
straight arms
Son
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a
hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket
put the moon in his pocket
for light; else
You must know
This tribute from us
Caesar's ambition
The sides o' the world
Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
Becomes a warlike people
Ourselves to be.
We do.
Say
Ordain'd our laws
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
Shall
His brows within a golden crown and call'd
Himself a king.
I am sorry
Caesar
Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:
Receive it from me
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied
Thou art welcome
Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;
Which he to seek of me again
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
So Caesar shall not find them.
Let proof speak.
His majesty bids you welcome. Make
pastime with us a day or two
you seek us afterwards in other terms
shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
beat us out of it
the adventure
for you; and there's an end.
So
I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
All the remain is 'Welcome!'
Exeunt
SCENE II. Another room in the palace.
Enter PISANIO
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:
She's punish'd for her truth
As would take in some virtue. O my master!
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
Upon the love and truth and vows which I
Have made to thy command? I
If it be so to do good service
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I
so much as this fact comes to?
Reading
'Do't: the letter
that I have sent her
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble
So virgin-like without? Lo
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
Enter IMOGEN
How now
Madam
Who? thy lord? that is my lord
O
That knew the stars as I his characters;
He'ld lay the future open. You good gods
That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them
You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:
Though forfeiters you cast in prison
You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news

O
He is at Milford-Haven: read
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
May plod it in a week
Glide thither in a day? Then
Who long'st
let me bate
For mine's beyond beyond--say
Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing
To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
To inherit such a haven: but first of all
That we shall make in time
And our return
Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee
'Twixt hour and hour?
One score 'twixt sun and sun
Aside
and too much too.
Why
riding wagers
That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:
Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
A riding-suit
A franklin's housewife.
Madam
I see before me
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say
Exeunt
SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.
Enter
A goodly day not to keep house
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
And keep their impious turbans on
Good morrow to the sun. Hail
We house i' the rock
As prouder livers do.
Hail
Hail
Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts
This service is not service
And often
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O
Is nobler than attending for a cheque
Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine
Out of your proof you speak: we
What air's from home. Haply this life is best
That have a sharper known; well corresponding
With your stiff age: but unto us it is
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
A prison for a debtor
To stride a limit.
What should we speak of
When we are old as you? when we shall hear
The rain and wind beat dark December
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
We are beastly
Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
We make a quire
How you speak!
Did you but know the city's usuries
And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
Is certain falling
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war
I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'
the search
As record of fair act; nay
The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
With Roman swords
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me
Was not far off: then was I as a tree
Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night
Uncertain favour!
My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
But that two villains
Before my perfect honour
I was confederate with the Romans: so
Follow'd my banishment
This rock and these demesnes have been my world;
Where I have lived at honest freedom
More pious debts to heaven than in all
The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;
To him the other two shall minister;
And we will fear no poison
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
These boys know little they are sons to the king;
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
They think they are mine; and though train'd
up thus meanly
I' the cave wherein they bow
The roofs of palaces
In simple and low things to prince it much
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore
The king his father call'd Guiderius
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
The warlike feats I have done
Into my story: say 'Thus
The princely blood flows in his cheek
That acts my words. The younger brother

Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon
Thinking to bar thee of succession
Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile

SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.
Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN
Thou told'st me
Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
To see me first
Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind
From the inward of thee? One
Beyond self-explication: put thyself
Into a havior of less fear
Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
Why tender'st thou that paper to me
A look untender? If't be summer news
But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him
May take off some extremity
Would be even mortal to me.
Please you
And you shall find me
The most disdain'd of fortune.
[Reads]  'Thy mistress
strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie
bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises
as I expect my revenge. That part thou
the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away
her life: I shall give thee opportunity at
Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose
where
it is done
equally to me disloyal.'
What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
Hath cut her throat already. No
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
All corners of the world: kings
This viperous slander enters. What cheer
False to his bed! What is it to be false?
To lie in watch there and to think on him?
To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep
charge nature
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed
Alas
I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
Whose mother was her painting
Poor I am stale
And
Put on for villany; not born where't grows
Good madam
True honest men being heard
Did scandal many a holy tear
From most true wretchedness: so thou
Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
From thy great fall. Come
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him
I draw the sword myself: take it
The innocent mansion of my love
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
Thy master is not there
The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
But now thou seem'st a coward.
Hence
Thou shalt not damn my hand.
Why
And if I do not by thy hand
No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
There is a prohibition so divine
That cravens my weak hand. Come
Something's afore't. Soft
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
Believe false teachers: though those that
are betray'd
Do feel the treason sharply
Stands in worse case of woe.
And thou
My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
And make me put into contempt the suits
Of princely fellows
It is no act of common passage
A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
To think
That now thou tirest on
Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding
O gracious lady
I have not slept one wink.
Do't
I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.
Wherefore then
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
So many miles with a pretence? this place?
Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far
But to win time
To lose so bad employment; in the which
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady
Talk thy tongue weary; speak
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear
Therein false struck
Then
Most like;
Bringing me here to kill me.
Not so
But if I were as wise as honest
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
But that my master is abused:
Some villain
Hath done you both this cursed injury.
Some Roman courtezan.
No
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court
Why good fellow
Or in my life what comfort
Dead to my husband?
If you'll back to the court--
No court
With that harsh
As fearful as a siege.
If not at court
Where then
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day
Our Britain seems as of it
In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee
There's livers out of Britain.
I am most glad
You think of other place. The ambassador
To-morrow: now
Dark as your fortune is
That which
But by self-danger
Pretty and full of view; yea
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
That though his actions were not visible
Report should render him hourly to your ear
As truly as he moves.
O
Though peril to my modesty
Well
You must forget to be a woman; change
Command into obedience: fear and niceness--
The handmaids of all women
Ready in gibes
As quarrelous as the weasel; nay
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek
Alack
Of common-kissing Titan
Your laboursome and dainty trims
You made great Juno angry.
Nay
I see into thy end
A man already.
First
Fore-thinking this
'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet
That answer to them: would you in their serving
From youth of such a season
Present yourself
wherein you're happy
With joy he will embrace you
And doubling that
Beginning nor supplyment.
Thou art all the comfort
The gods will diet me with. Prithee
There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
All that good time will give us: this attempt
I am soldier to
A prince's courage. Away
Well
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress
What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea
Will drive away distemper. To some shade
Direct you to the best!
Amen: I thank thee.
Exeunt
SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
Enter CYMBELINE
Thus far; and so farewell.
Thanks
My emperor hath wrote
And am right sorry that I must report ye
My master's enemy.
Our subjects
To show less sovereignty than they
Appear unkinglike.
So
A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
Madam
And you!
My lords
The due of honour in no point omit.
So farewell
Your hand
Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
I wear it as your enemy.
Sir
Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.
Leave not the worthy Lucius
Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords
He goes hence frowning: but it honours us
That we have given him cause.
'Tis all the better;
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:
The powers that he already hath in Gallia
Will soon be drawn to head
His war for Britain.
'Tis not sleepy business;
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
Our expectation that it would be thus
Hath made us forward. But
Before the Roman
The duty of the day: she looks us like
A thing more made of malice than of duty:
We have noted it. Call her before us; for
We have been too slight in sufferance.
Exit an Attendant
Royal sir
Hath her life been; the cure whereof
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
And strokes death to her.
Re-enter Attendant
Where is she
Can her contempt be answer'd?
Please you
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.
My lord
She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
Made me to blame in memory.
Her doors lock'd?
Not seen of late? Grant
Prove false!

Pisanio
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that
It is a thing most precious. But for her
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
To death or to dishonour; and my end
Can make good use of either: she being down
Re-enter CLOTEN
How now
'Tis certain she is fled.
Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none
Dare come about him.
[Aside]            All the better: may
This night forestall him of the coming day!
Exit
I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal
Than lady
The best she hath
Disdaining me and throwing favours on
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
That what's else rare is choked; and in that point
I will conclude to hate her
Enter PISANIO
Who is here? What
Come hither: ah
Thou art straightway with the fiends.
O
Where is thy lady? Or
I will not ask again. Close villain
Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
A dram of worth be drawn.
Alas
He is in Rome.
Where is she
No further halting: satisfy me home
What is become of her.
O
All-worthy villain!
Discover where thy mistress is at once
Speak
Thy condemnation and thy death.
Then
Touching her flight.
Presenting a letter
Let's see't. I will pursue her
Even to Augustus' throne.
[Aside]                 Or this
She's far enough; and what he learns by this
May prove his travel
Hum!
[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen
Sirrah
Sir
It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah
wouldst not be a villain
cause to use thee with a serious industry
directly and truly

relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
Well
Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and
constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
that beggar Posthumus
course of gratitude
mine: wilt thou serve me?
Sir
Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy
late master's garments in thy possession?
I have
wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
The first service thou dost me
hither: let it be thy lint service; go.
I shall
Exit
Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one
thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there
villain Posthumus
garments were come. She said upon a time--the
bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
than my noble and natural person together with the
adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
back
eyes; there shall she see my valour
be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground
speech of insultment ended on his dead body
when my lust hath dined
her I will execute in the clothes that she so
praised
her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly
Re-enter PISANIO
Be those the garments?
Ay
How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?
She can scarce be there yet.
Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second
thing that I have commanded thee: the third is
but duteous
to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had
wings to follow it! Come
Exit
Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
Were to prove false
Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!
Exit
SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.
Enter IMOGEN
I see a man's life is a tedious one:
I have tired myself
Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick
Foundations fly the wretched; such
I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder
Is sorer than to lie for need
Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee
At point to sink for food. But what is this?
Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:
I were best not to call; I dare not call:
yet famine
Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
If any thing that's civil
Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy
But fear the sword like me
Such a foe
Exit
Enter BELARIUS
You
Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I
Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:
The sweat of industry would dry and die
Will make what's homely savoury: weariness
Can snore upon the flint
Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here
I am thoroughly weary.
I am weak with toil
There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that
[Looking into the cave]
Stay; come not in.
But that it eats our victuals
Here were a fairy.
What's the matter
By Jupiter
No elder than a boy!
Re-enter IMOGEN
Good masters
Before I enter'd here
To have begg'd or bought what I have took:
good troth
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:
I would have left it on the board so soon
As I had made my meal
With prayers for the provider.
Money
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
As 'tis no better reckon'd
Who worship dirty gods.
I see you're angry:
Know
Have died had I not made it.
Whither bound?
To Milford-Haven.
What's your name?
Fidele
Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;

Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.

'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians
Full weak to undertake our wars against
The fall'n-off Britons
The gentry to this business. He creates
Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes
His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
Is Lucius general of the forces?
Ay.
Remaining now in Gallia?

Which I have spoke of
Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
Will tie you to the numbers and the time
Of their dispatch.
We will discharge our duty.

ACT IV
SCENE I. Wales: near the cave of Belarius.
Enter CLOTEN
I am near to the place where they should meet
Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
serve me! Why should his mistress
him that made the tailor
rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said
a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must
play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it
is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
in his own chamber--I mean
as well drawn as his; no less young
advantage of the time
conversant in general services
in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!

[To IMOGEN]  You are not well: remain here in the cave;
We'll come to you after hunting.
"[To IMOGEN]	Brother"
Are we not brothers?
So man and man should be;
But clay and clay differs in dignity
Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
So sick I am not
But not so citizen a wanton as
To seem to die ere sick: so please you
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
Is breach of all. I am ill
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
To one not sociable: I am not very sick
I'll rob none but myself; and let me die
I love thee; I have spoke it
How much the quantity
What! how! how!
If it be sin to say so
In my good brother's fault: I know not why
I love this youth; and I have heard you say
'My father
"[Aside]	O noble strain!"
O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:
Nature hath meal and bran
I'm not their father; yet who this should be
'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.
Brother
I wish ye sport.
You health. So please you
[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods
I have heard!
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
Experience
The imperious seas breed monsters
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio
Swallows some
I could not stir him:
He said he was gentle
Dishonestly afflicted
Thus did he answer me: yet said
I might know more.
To the field
We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
We'll not be long away.
Pray
Well or ill
And shalt be ever.
Exit IMOGEN
This youth
Good ancestors.
How angel-like he sings!
But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
In characters
And he her dieter.
Nobly he yokes
A smiling with a sigh
Was that it was
The smile mocking the sigh
From so divine a temple
With winds that sailors rail at.
I do note
That grief and patience
Grow
And let the stinking elder
His perishing root with the increasing vine!
It is great morning. Come
Who's there?
Enter CLOTEN
I cannot find those runagates; that villain
Hath mock'd me. I am faint.
'Those runagates!'
Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
Cloten
I saw him not these many years
I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!
He is but one: you and my brother search
What companies are near: pray you
Let me alone with him.
Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
Soft! What are you
That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?
I have heard of such. What slave art thou?
A thing
More slavish did I ne'er than answering
A slave without a knock.
Thou art a robber
To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
Thy words
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art
Thou villain base
No
Thou precious varlet
Hence
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
I am loath to beat thee.
Thou injurious thief
What's thy name?
Cloten
Cloten
Adder
To thy further fear
I am son to the queen.
I am sorry for 't; not seeming
So worthy as thy birth.
Art not afeard?
Those that I reverence those I fear
At fools I laugh
Die the death:
When I have slain thee with my proper hand
Yield
Exeunt
Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
No companies abroad?
None in the world: you did mistake him
I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice
'Twas very Cloten.
In this place we left them:
I wish my brother make good time with him
Being scarce made up
Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment
Is oft the cause of fear. But
Re-enter GUIDERIUS
This Cloten was a fool
There was no money in't: not Hercules
Could have knock'd out his brains
Yet I not doing this
My head as I do his.
What hast thou done?
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head
Who call'd me traitor
With his own single hand he'ld take us in
Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow
We are all undone.
Why
Protects not us: then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
Discover you abroad?
No single soul
Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
He must have some attendants. Though his humour
Was nothing but mutation
From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy
Absolute madness could so far have raved
To bring him here alone; although perhaps
It may be heard at court that such as we
Cave here
May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--
As it is like him--might break out
He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable
To come alone
More perilous than the head.
Let ordinance
Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er
I had no mind
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
Did make my way long forth.
With his own sword
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
Behind our rock; and let it to the sea
That's all I reck.
Exit
I fear 'twill be revenged:
Would
Becomes thee well enough.
Would I had done't
So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore
Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges
And put us to our answer.
Well
We'll hunt no more to-day
Where there's no profit. I prithee
You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
Till hasty Polydote return
To dinner presently.
Poor sick Fidele!
I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood
Exit
O thou goddess
In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
As zephyrs blowing below the violet
That an invisible instinct should frame them
To royalty unlearn'd
That wildly grows in them
As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
What Cloten's being here to us portends
Re-enter GUIDERIUS
Where's my brother?
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream
For his return.
Solemn music
My ingenious instrument!
Hark
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
Is he at home?
He went hence even now.
What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
it did not speak before. All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
Is Cadwal mad?
Look
Of what we blame him for.
Re-enter ARVIRAGUS
The bird is dead
That we have made so much on. I had rather
Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty
O sweetest
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
As when thou grew'st thyself.
O melancholy!
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
The ooze
Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I
How found you him?

Thus smiling
right cheek
Reposing on a cushion.
Where?
O' the floor;
His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept
My clouted brogues from off my feet
Answer'd my steps too loud.
Why
If he be gone
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted
With fairest flowers
Whilst summer lasts and I live here
The flower that's like thy face
The azured harebell
The leaf of eglantine
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
Without a monument!--bring thee all this;
Yea
Prithee
And do not play in wench-like words with that
Which is so serious. Let us bury him
Is now due debt. To the grave!
Say
By good Euriphile
Be't so:
And let us
Have got the mannish crack
Cadwal
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Than priests and fanes that lie.
We'll speak it
Great griefs
Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son
And though he came our enemy
He was paid for that: though mean and
mighty
Together
Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely
And though you took his life
Pray You
Thersites' body is as good as Ajax'
If you'll go fetch him
Exit BELARIUS
Nay
My father hath a reason for't.
'Tis true.
Come on then
So. Begin.
SONG
Fear no more the heat o' the sun
Thou thy worldly task hast done
Golden lads and girls all must
Fear no more the frown o' the great;
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
Care no more to clothe and eat;
To thee the reed is as the oak:
The sceptre
All follow this
Fear no more the lightning flash
Fear not slander
Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:
All lovers young
Consign to thee
No exorciser harm thee!
Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
Nothing ill come near thee!
Quiet consummation have;
And renowned be thy grave!
Re-enter BELARIUS
We have done our obsequies: come
Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
You were as flowers
These herblets shall
Come on
The ground that gave them first has them again:
Their pleasures here are past
Exeunt BELARIUS
[Awaking]  Yes
the way?--
I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray
'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--
I have gone all night. 'Faith
But
Seeing the body of CLOTEN
These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
This bloody man
For so I thought I was a cave-keeper
'Twas but a bolt of nothing
Are sometimes like our judgments
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
As a wren's eye
The dream's here still: even when I wake
Without me
A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;
His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face
Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
Hath with his forged letters
From this most bravest vessel of the world
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas
where's that?
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart
'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
Have laid this woe here. O
The drug he gave me
And cordial to me
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:
This is Pisanio's deed
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood
Which chance to find us: O
Falls on the body
Enter LUCIUS
To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia
You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
They are in readiness.
But what from Rome?
The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
And gentlemen of Italy
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo
When expect you them?
With the next benefit o' the wind.
This forwardness
Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now
Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--
I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:
I saw Jove's bird
From the spongy south to this part of the west
Unless my sins abuse my divination--
Success to the Roman host.
Dream often so
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
It was a worthy building. How! a page!
Or dead
For nature doth abhor to make his bed
With the defunct
Let's see the boy's face.
He's alive
He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one
They crave to be demanded. Who is this
Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
That
In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?
What art thou?
I am nothing: or if not
There is no more such masters: I may wander
From east to occident
Find such another master.
'Lack
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
Thy master in bleeding: say his name
Richard du Champ.
Aside
If I do lie and do
No harm by it
They'll pardon it.--Say you
Thy name?
Fidele
Thou dost approve thyself the very same:
Thy name well fits thy faith
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
Thou shalt be so well master'd
Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.
I'll follow
As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave
And leaving so his service
Ay
And rather father thee than master thee.
My friends
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can
A grave: come
By thee to us
As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes
Some falls are means the happier to arise.
Exeunt
SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
Enter CYMBELINE
Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.
Exit an Attendant
A fever with the absence of her son
Upon a desperate bed
When fearful wars point at me; her son gone
The hope of comfort. But for thee
Dost seem so ignorant
By a sharp torture.
Sir
I humbly set it at your will; but
Good my liege
I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten
The time is troublesome.
To PISANIO
We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
Does yet depend.
So please your majesty
Of Roman gentlemen
Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
I am amazed with matter.
Good my liege
Than what you hear of: come more
you're ready:
The want is but to put those powers in motion
That long to move.
I thank you. Let's withdraw;
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
What can from Italy annoy us; but
We grieve at chances here. Away!
Exeunt all but PISANIO
I heard no letter from my master since
I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
To yield me often tidings: neither know I
What is betid to Cloten; but remain
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true
These present wars shall find I love my country
All other doubts
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.
Exit
SCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius.
Enter BELARIUS
The noise is round about us.
Let us from it.
What pleasure
From action and adventure?
Nay
Have we in hiding us? This way
Must or for Britons slay us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use
Sons
To the king's party there's no going: newness
Of Cloten's death--we being not known
Among the bands--may drive us to a render
Where we have lived
Which we have done
Drawn on with torture.
This is
In such a time nothing becoming you
It is not likely
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now
O
Of many in the army: many years
From my remembrance. And
Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;
Who find in my exile the want of breeding
To have the courtesy your cradle promised
The shrinking slaves of winter.
Than be so
Better to cease to be. Pray
I and my brother are not known; yourself
So out of thought
By this sun that shines
Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood
Never bestrid a horse
A rider like myself
Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
To look upon the holy sun
The benefit of his blest beams
So long a poor unknown.
By heavens
If you will bless me
The hands of Romans!
"So say I	amen."
No reason I
So slight a valuation
My crack'd one to more care. Have with you
If in your country wars you chance to die
Lead
Aside
The time seems long; their blood
thinks scorn
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.
Enter POSTHUMUS
Yea
Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones
Must murder wives much better than themselves
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
Every good servant does not all commands:
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
The noble Imogen to repent
Me
To second ills with ills
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills
Among the Italian gentry
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
That
I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
Against the part I come with; so I'll die
For thee
Is every breath a death; and thus
Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
More valour in me than my habits show.
Gods
To shame the guise o' the world
The fashion
Exit
SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.
Enter
The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours
As I wear mine
If that thy gentry
This lout as he exceeds our lords
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.
Exit
The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is  taken: then enter
Stand
The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
The villany of our fears.
Stand
Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
Away
For friends kill friends
As war were hoodwink'd.
'Tis their fresh supplies.
It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
Let's reinforce
Exeunt
SCENE III. Another part of the field.
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord
Camest thou from where they made the stand?
I did.
Though you
I did.
No blame be to you
Of his wings destitute
Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted
More plentiful than tools to do't
Some mortally
Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd
With dead men hurt behind
To die with lengthen'd shame.
Where was this lane?
Close by the battle
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
So long a breeding as his white beard came to
The country base than to commit such slaughter
With faces fit for masks
Than those for preservation cased
Made good the passage; cried to those that fled
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;
Or we are Romans and will give you that
Like beasts which you shun beastly
These three
For three performers are the file when all
The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand
Accommodated by the place
With their own nobleness
A distaff to a lance
But by example--O
The way that they did
Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
A stop i' the chaser
A rout
Chickens
The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open
Of the unguarded hearts
Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
O'er borne i' the former wave: ten
Those that would die or ere resist are grown
The mortal bugs o' the field.
This was strange chance
A narrow lane
Nay
Rather to wonder at the things you hear
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't
'Two boys
Nay
'Lack
Who dares not stand his foe
For if he'll do as he is made to do
You have put me into rhyme.
Farewell; you're angry.
Still going?
Exit Lord
This is a lord! O noble misery
To-day how many would have given their honours
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't
That draw his knives i' the war. Well
For being now a favourer to the Briton
The part I came in: fight I will no more
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
Britons must take. For me
On either side I come to spend my breath;
Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again
Enter two British Captains and Soldiers
Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
There was a fourth man
So 'tis reported:
But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
A Roman
Had answer'd him.
Lay hands on him; a dog!
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
What crows have peck'd them here. He brags
his service
As if he were of note: bring him to the king.
Enter CYMBELINE
SCENE IV. A British prison.
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers
You shall not now be stol'n
So graze as you find pasture.
Ay
Exeunt Gaolers
Most welcome
Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
By the sure physician
To unbar these locks. My conscience
More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt
So children temporal fathers do appease;
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
I cannot do it better than in gyves
No stricter render of me than my all.
I know you are more clement than vile men
On their abatement: that's not my desire:
For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
'Tis not so dear
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
Though light
You rather mine
I'll speak to thee in silence.
Sleeps
Solemn music. Enter
No more
Thy spite on mortal flies:
With Mars fall out
Rates and revenges.
Hath my poor boy done aught but well
I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
Attending nature's law:
Whose father then
Thou orphans' father art
From this earth-vexing smart.
Lucina lent not me her aid
That from me was Posthumus ript
Great nature
When once he was mature for man
That could stand up his parallel;
Or fruitful object be
In eye of Imogen
Could deem his dignity?
With marriage wherefore was he mock'd
From Leonati seat
From her his dearest one
Why did you suffer Iachimo
With needless jealosy;
And to become the geck and scorn
O' th' other's villany?
For this from stiller seats we came
Fell bravely and were slain
With honour to maintain.
Like hardiment Posthumus hath
To Cymbeline perform'd:
Then
The graces for his merits due
Thy crystal window ope; look out;
No longer exercise
Upon a valiant race thy harsh
And potent injuries.
Since
Peep through thy marble mansion; help;
Or we poor ghosts will cry
To the shining synod of the rest
Against thy deity.
Help
Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning
No more
Accuse the thunderer
Poor shadows of Elysium
Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:
Be not with mortal accidents opprest;
No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift
Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:
His comforts thrive
Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth
Our temple was he married. Rise
He shall be lord of lady Imogen
This tablet lay upon his breast
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:
and so
Express impatience
Mount
Ascends
He came in thunder; his celestial breath
Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle
Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is
More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird
Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
Thanks
The marble pavement closes
His radiant root. Away! and
The Apparitions vanish
[Waking]  Sleep
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers: but
Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
On greatness' favour dream as I have done
Many dream not to find
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
Be not
Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects
So follow
Reads
'When as a lion's whelp shall
tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be
lopped branches
freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries
'Tis still a dream
Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
As sense cannot untie. Be what it is
I'll keep
Re-enter First Gaoler
Come
Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
Hanging is the word
you be ready for that
So
spectators
A heavy reckoning for you
more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of
parting
flint for want of meat
much drink; sorry that you have paid too much
sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain
both empty; the brain the heavier for being too
light
heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
quit. O
thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
creditor but it; of what's past
counters; so the acquittance follows.
I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
Indeed
tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
sleep
would change places with his officer; for
Yes
Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen
him so pictured: you must either be directed by
some that take upon them to know
yourself that which I am sure you do not know
jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how
you shall speed in your journey's end
never return to tell one.
I tell thee
direct them the way I am going
will not use them.
What an infinite mock is this
have the best use of eyes to see the way of
blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.
Enter a Messenger
Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.
Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.
I'll be hang'd then.
Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.
Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger
Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
gibbets

too that die against their wills; so should I
were one. I would we were all of one mind

gallowses! I speak against my present profit
my wish hath a preferment in 't.
Exeunt
SCENE V. Cymbeline's tent.
Enter CYMBELINE
Stand by my side
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
That the poor soldier that so richly fought
Stepp'd before larges of proof
He shall be happy that can find him
Our grace can make him so.
I never saw
Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
Such precious deeds in one that promises nought
But beggary and poor looks.
No tidings of him?
He hath been search'd among the dead and living
To my grief
The heir of his reward;
To BELARIUS
which I will add
To you
To ask of whence you are. Report it.
Sir
Further to boast were neither true nor modest
Bow your knees.
Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you
Companions to our person and will fit you
With dignities becoming your estates.
Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies
There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
Greet you our victory? you look like Romans
Hail
To sour your happiness
The queen is dead.
Who worse than a physician
Would this report become? But I consider
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
With horror
Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
I will report
Can trip me
Were present when she finish'd.
Prithee
First
Affected greatness got by you
Married your royalty
Abhorr'd your person.
She alone knew this;
And
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
Your daughter
With such integrity
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life
Ta'en off by poison.
O most delicate fiend!
Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?
More
For you a mortal mineral; which
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed
O'ercome you with her show
Her son into the adoption of the crown:
But
Of heaven and men
The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so
Despairing died.
Heard you all this
We did
Mine eyes
Were not in fault
Mine ears
been vicious
To have mistrusted her: yet
That it was folly in me
Enter LUCIUS
Thou comest not
The Britons have razed out
Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
Of you their captives
So think of your estate.
Consider
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
Will have it thus
May be call'd ransom
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:
Augustus lives to think on't: and so much
For my peculiar care. This one thing only
I will entreat; my boy
A page so kind
With my request
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm
I have surely seen him:
His favour is familiar to me. Boy
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt
Yea
I humbly thank your highness.
I do not bid thee beg my life
And yet I know thou wilt.
No
Bitter to me as death: your life
The boy disdains me
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
Why stands he so perplex'd?
What wouldst thou
I love thee more and more: think more and more
What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak
He is a Roman; no more kin to me
Than I to your highness; who
Wherefore eyest him so?
I'll tell you
To give me hearing.
Ay
Fidele
Thou'rt my good youth
I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.
CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart
Is not this boy revived from death?
One sand another
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
Who died
The same dead thing alive.
Peace
Creatures may be alike: were 't he
He would have spoke to us.
But we saw him dead.
Be silent; let's see further.
"[Aside]	It is my mistress:"
Since she is living
To good or bad.
CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward
Come
Make thy demand aloud.
To IACHIMO
Sir
Give answer to this boy
Or
Winnow the truth from falsehood. On
My boon is
Of whom he had this ring.
[Aside]                 What's that to him?
That diamond upon your finger
How came it yours?
Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
Which
How! me?
I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
Which torments me to conceal. By villany
I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;
Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may
grieve thee
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more
All that belongs to this.
That paragon
For whom my heart drops blood
Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.
My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
Than die ere I hear more: strive
Upon a time
That struck the hour!--it was in Rome
The mansion where!--'twas at a feast
Our viands had been poison'd
Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--
What should I say? he was too good to be
Where ill men were; and was the best of all
Amongst the rarest of good ones
For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
Of him that best could speak
The shrine of Venus
Postures beyond brief nature
Loves woman for
I stand on fire:
Come to the matter.
All too soon I shall
That had a royal lover
And
He was as calm as virtue--he began
His mistress' picture; which by his tongue
being made
Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls
Proved us unspeaking sots.
Nay
Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
He spake of her
Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
Upon his honour'd finger
In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
By hers and mine adultery. He
Than I did truly find her
And would so
Of Phoebus' wheel
Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
Post I in this design: well may you
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd
Of hope
'Gan in your duller Britain operate
Most vilely; for my vantage
And
To make the noble Leonatus mad
With tokens thus
Of chamber-hanging
O cunning
Of secret on her person
But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd
Methinks
[Advancing]             Ay
That's due to all the villains past
For torturers ingenious: it is I
That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
By being worse than they. I am Posthumus
That caused a lesser villain than myself
Of virtue was she; yea
Spit
The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain
Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and
Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!
My queen
Peace
Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page
Striking her: she falls
O
Mine and your mistress! O
You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help
Mine honour'd lady!
Does the world go round?
How come these staggers on me?
Wake
If this be so
To death with mortal joy.
How fares thy mistress?
O
Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow
Breathe not where princes are.
The tune of Imogen!
Lady
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
New matter still?
It poison'd me.
O gods!
I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
Have
Which I gave him for cordial
As I would serve a rat.'
What's this
The queen
To temper poisons for her
The satisfaction of her knowledge only
In killing creatures vile
Was of more danger
A certain stuff
The present power of life
All offices of nature should again
Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
Most like I did
My boys
This is
Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
Think that you are upon a rock; and now
Throw me again.
Embracing him
Hang there like a fruit
How now
What
Wilt thou not speak to me?
[Kneeling]               Your blessing
[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did love
this youth
You had a motive for't.
My tears that fall
Prove holy water on thee! Imogen
I am sorry for't
O
That we meet here so strangely: but her son
Is gone
My lord
With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth
Then in my pocket; which directed him
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
Where
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
My lady's honour: what became of him
I further know not.
Let me end the story:
I slew him there.
Marry
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Pluck a bard sentence: prithee
I have spoke it
He was a prince.
A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
With language that would make me spurn the sea
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine.
I am sorry for thee:
By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd
Endure our law: thou'rt dead.
That headless man
I thought had been my lord.
Bind the offender
Stay
This man is better than the man he slew
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
Had ever scar for.
To the Guard
Let his arms alone;
They were not born for bondage.
Why
As good as we?
In that he spake too far.
And thou shalt die for't.
We will die all three:
But I will prove that two on's are as good
As I have given out him. My sons
Your danger's ours.
And our good his.
Have at it then
Thou hadst
Was call'd Belarius.
What of him? he is
A banish'd traitor.
He it is that hath
Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;
I know not how a traitor.
Take him hence:
The whole world shall not save him.
Not too hot:
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
And let it be confiscate all
As I have received it.
Nursing of my sons!
I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
Ere I arise
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir
And think they are my sons
They are the issue of your loins
How! my issue!
So sure as you your father's. I
Your pleasure was my mere offence
Itself
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
For such and so they are--these twenty years
Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
Could put into them; my breeding was
Your highness knows. Their nurse
Upon my banishment: I moved her to't
Excited me to treason: their dear loss
Unto my end of stealing them. But
Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
The benediction of these covering heavens
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
To inlay heaven with stars.
Thou weep'st
The service that you three have done is more
Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
If these be they
A pair of worthier sons.
Be pleased awhile.
This gentleman
This gentleman
In a most curious mantle
Of his queen mother
I can with ease produce.
Guiderius had
Upon his neck a mole
It was a mark of wonder.
This is he;
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
It was wise nature's end in the donation
O
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be
No
I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers
But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother
Did you e'er meet?
Ay
And at first meeting loved;
Continued so
By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
O rare instinct!
When shall I hear all through? This fierce
abridgement
Hath to it circumstantial branches
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These
I know not how much more
And all the other by-dependencies
Will serve our long inter'gatories. See
On him
Each object with a joy: the counterchange
Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground
To BELARIUS
Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.
You are my father too
All o'erjoy'd
My good master
Happy be you!
The forlorn soldier
The thankings of a king.
I am
In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he
Have made you finish.
[Kneeling]          I am down again:
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
That ever swore her faith.
Kneel not to me:
The power that I have on you is
The malice towards you to forgive you: live
Nobly doom'd!
We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
Pardon's the word to all.
You holp us
Joy'd are we that you are.
Your servant
Great Jupiter
Of mine own kindred: when I waked
This label on my bosom; whose containing
Is so from sense in hardness
Make no collection of it: let him show
His skill in the construction.
Philarmonus!
Here
Read
[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall
unknown
piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar
shall be lopped branches
years
stock
his miseries
peace and plenty.'
Thou
The fit and apt construction of thy name
To CYMBELINE
The piece of tender air
We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine
Is this most constant wife; who
With this most tender air.
This hath some seeming.
The lofty cedar
Thy two sons forth; who
Promises Britain peace and plenty.
Well
My peace we will begin. And
To pay our wonted tribute
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
Whom heavens
The fingers of the powers above do tune
The harmony of this peace. The vision
Which I made known to Lucius
Of this yet scarce-cold battle
Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle
So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline
Laud we the gods;
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
A Roman and a British ensign wave
Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:
And in the temple of great Jupiter
Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
Set on there! Never was a war did cease
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
Who's there?
Nay
Long live the king!
Bernardo?
He.
You come most carefully upon your hour.
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold
Have you had quiet guard?
Not a mouse stirring.
Well
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus
I think I hear them. Stand
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Give you good night.
O
Who hath relieved you?
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
Exit
Holla! Bernardo!
Say
A piece of him.
Welcome
What
I have seen nothing.
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy
Touching this dreaded sight
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come
Tush
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears
What we have two nights seen.
Well
Last night of all
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns
Enter Ghost
Peace
In the same figure
Thou art a scholar; speak to it
Looks it not like the king?  mark it
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
It would be spoke to.
Question it
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee
It is offended.
See
Stay! speak
Exit Ghost
'Tis gone
How now
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
Before my God
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
Is it not like the king?
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once
'Tis strange.
Thus twice before
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion
Good now
So nightly toils the subject of the land
Why such impress of shipwrights
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
That can I;
At least
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact
Which he stood seized of
Against the which
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us
And terms compulsatory
So by his father lost: and this
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events
And prologue to the omen coming on
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft
Re-enter Ghost
I'll cross it
If thou hast any sound
If there be any good thing to be done
Cock crows
If thou art privy to thy country's fate
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Do
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
'Tis gone!
Exit Ghost
We do it wrong
For it is
It was about to speak
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
Awake the god of day; and
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated
And then
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But
Break we our watch up; and by my advice
Unto young Hamlet; for
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
Let's do't
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Therefore our sometime sister
With an auspicious and a dropping eye
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms
With this affair along. For all
Now follows
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame
Lost by his father
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway
Who
Of this his nephew's purpose
His further gait herein; in that the levies
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell
In that and all things will we show our duty.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
And now
You told us of some suit; what is't
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
The head is not more native to the heart
What wouldst thou have
My dread lord
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
He hath
By laboursome petition
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you
Take thy fair hour
But now
[Aside]  A little more than kin
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Not so
Good Hamlet
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die
Ay
If it be
Seems
'Tis not alone my inky cloak
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature
But
That father lost
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven
Is death of fathers
This unprevailing woe
As of a father: for let the world take note
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son
In going back to school in Wittenberg
And we beseech you
Here
Let not thy mother lose her prayers
I pray thee
I shall in all my best obey you
Why
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof
Exeunt all but HAMLET
O
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay
So excellent a king; that was
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why
By what it fed on: and yet
Let me not think on't--Frailty
A little month
With which she follow'd my poor father's body
O
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break
Enter HORATIO
Hail to your lordship!
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio
The same
Sir
And what make you from Wittenberg
My good lord--
I am very glad to see you. Good even
But what
A truant disposition
I would not hear your enemy say so
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
My lord
I pray thee
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
Indeed
Thrift
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day
My father!--methinks I see my father.
Where
In my mind's eye
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
He was a man
My lord
Saw? who?
My lord
The king my father!
Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear
For God's love
Two nights together had these gentlemen
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes
Almost to jelly with the act of fear
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where
These hands are not more like.
But where was this?
My lord
Did you not speak to it?
My lord
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion
But even then the morning cock crew loud
'Tis very strange.
As I do live
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
Indeed
Hold you the watch to-night?
We do
Arm'd
Arm'd
From top to toe?
My lord
Then saw you not his face?
O
What
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Pale or red?
Nay
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Most constantly.
I would I had been there.
It would have much amazed you.
Very like
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Longer
Not when I saw't.
His beard was grizzled--no?
It was
I will watch to-night;
Perchance 'twill walk again.
I warrant it will.
If it assume my noble father's person
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night
I will requite your loves. So
Upon the platform
Our duty to your honour.
Your loves
Exeunt all but HAMLET
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Till then sit still
Exit
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And
And convoy is assistant
Do you doubt that?
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour
No more but so?
Think it no more;
For nature
In thews and bulk
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now
The virtue of his will: but you must fear
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep
Whiles
O
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Enter POLONIUS
A double blessing is a double grace
Yet here
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue
Be thou familiar
Those friends thou hast
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd
Of entrance to a quarrel
Give every man thy ear
Take each man's censure
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
For the apparel oft proclaims the man
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend
This above all: to thine ownself be true
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Most humbly do I take my leave
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
Farewell
What I have said to you.
'Tis in my memory lock'd
Farewell.
Exit
What is't
So please you
Marry
'Tis told me
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
If it be so
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? give me up the truth.
He hath
Of his affection to me.
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl
Do you believe his tenders
I do not know
Marry
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase
My lord
In honourable fashion.
Ay
And hath given countenance to his speech
Ay
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you: in few
I would not
Look to't
I shall obey
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The platform.
Enter HAMLET
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve.
No
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
A flourish of trumpets
What does this mean
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse
And
The triumph of his pledge.
Is it a custom?
Ay
But to my mind
And to the manner born
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements
So
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion
The form of plausive manners
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.
Look
Enter Ghost
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say
Ghost beckons HAMLET
It beckons you to go away with it
To you alone.
Look
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.
No
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
Do not
Why
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
And for my soul
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
What if it tempt you toward the flood
That beetles o'er his base into the sea
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
You shall not go
Hold off your hands.
Be ruled; you shall not go.
My fate cries out
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me
By heaven
I say
Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Heaven will direct it.
Nay
Exeunt
SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
Enter GHOST and HAMLET
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Mark me.
I will.
My hour is almost come
Must render up myself.
Alas
Pity me not
To what I shall unfold.
Speak; I am bound to hear.
So art thou to revenge
What?
I am thy father's spirit
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house
Would harrow up thy soul
And each particular hair to stand on end
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
O God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder!
Murder most foul
But this most foul
Haste me to know't
As meditation or the thoughts of love
I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
'Tis given out that
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused: but know
Now wears his crown.
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Ay
O wicked wit and gifts
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet
From me
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue
But
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body
And curd
And a most instant tetter bark'd about
Thus was I
Of life
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
With all my imperfections on my head:
O
If thou hast nature in thee
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near
Adieu
Exit
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell? O
And you
Ay
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain
O most pernicious woman!
O villain
My tables
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
Writing
So
It is 'Adieu
I have sworn 't.
[Within]  My lord
"[Within]	Lord Hamlet"
"[Within]	Heaven secure him!"
So be it!

Hillo
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
How is't
What news
O
Good my lord
No; you'll reveal it.
Not I
Nor I
How say you
But you'll be secret?
Ay
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.
There needs no ghost
To tell us this.
Why
And so
You
For every man has business and desire
These are but wild and whirling words
I'm sorry they offend you
Yes
There's no offence
Yes
For your desire to know what is between us
What is't
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
My lord
Nay
In faith
Nor I
Upon my sword.
We have sworn
Indeed
[Beneath]  Swear.
Ah
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Consent to swear.
Propose the oath
Never to speak of this that you have seen
[Beneath]  Swear.
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither
Never to speak of this that you have heard
[Beneath]  Swear.
Well said
A worthy pioner! Once more remove
O day and night
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth
Here
To put an antic disposition on
Or 'If we list to speak
Or such ambiguous giving out
That you know aught of me: this not to do
[Beneath]  Swear.
Rest
They swear
So
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do
And still your fingers on your lips
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite
Nay
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.
Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO
Give him this money and these notes
I will
You shall do marvellous wisely
Of his behavior.
My lord
Marry
And how
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Take you
As thus
Ay
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
But
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
But
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.
As gaming
Ay
My lord
'Faith
You must not put another scandal on him
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty
But
Wherefore should you do this?
Ay
Marry
And I believe
You laying these slight sullies on my son
The youth you breathe of guilty
He closes with you in this consequence;
'Good sir
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.
Very good
And then
about to say? By the mass
something: where did I leave?
At 'closes in the consequence
and 'gentleman.'
At 'closes in the consequence
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance
Videlicet
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach
So by my former lecture and advice
My lord
God be wi' you; fare you well.
Good my lord!
Observe his inclination in yourself.
I shall
And let him ply his music.
Well
Farewell!
Exit REYNALDO
Enter OPHELIA
How now
O
With what
My lord
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors
Mad for thy love?
My lord
But truly
What said he?
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last
And thrice his head thus waving up and down
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being: that done
And
For out o' doors he went without their helps
Come
This is the very ecstasy of love
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What
No
His access to me.
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle
By heaven
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come
This must be known; which
move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS
Welcome
Moreover that we much did long to see you
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it
Resembles that it was. What it should be
So much from the understanding of himself
Some little time: so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures
Good gentlemen
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile
As fits a king's remembrance.
Both your majesties
Might
Than to entreaty.
But we both obey
To lay our service freely at your feet
Thanks
Thanks
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son. Go
Heavens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpful to him!
Ay
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ
Enter POLONIUS
The ambassadors from Norway
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Have I
And I do think
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath used to do
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
O
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
Thyself do grace to them
Exit POLONIUS
He tells me
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
I doubt it is no other but the main;
His father's death
Well
Re-enter POLONIUS
Welcome
Say
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
But
It was against your highness: whereat grieved
Was falsely borne in hand
On Fortinbras; which he
Receives rebuke from Norway
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
Whereon old Norway
With an entreaty
That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise
As therein are set down.
It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time well read
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
Most welcome home!
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
This business is well ended.
My liege
What majesty should be
Therefore
Mad call I it; for
But let that go.
More matter
Madam
That he is mad
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
But farewell it
Mad let us grant him
That we find out the cause of this effect
Thus it remains
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--

'To the celestial and my soul's idol
beautified Ophelia
That's an ill phrase
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
Reads
'In her excellent white bosom
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Good madam
Reads
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.
'O dear Ophelia
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I love thee best
'Thine evermore most dear lady
this machine is to him
This
But how hath she
Received his love?
What do you think of me?
As of a man faithful and honourable.
I would fain prove so. But what might you think
As I perceived it
What might you think? No
'Lord Hamlet is a prince
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her
Which done
And he
Fell into a sadness
Do you think 'tis this?
It may be
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
That I have positively said 'Tis so
When it proved otherwise?
Not that I know.
[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
Take this from this
If circumstances lead me
Where truth is hid
Within the centre.
How may we try it further?
You know
Here in the lobby.
So he does indeed.
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Mark the encounter: if he love her not
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon
We will try it.
But
Away
I'll board him presently.
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS
Enter HAMLET
O
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
Well
Do you know me
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
Not I
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Honest
Ay
one man picked out of ten thousand.
That's very true
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog
god kissing carrion
I have
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend
[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
was a fishmonger: he is far gone
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
What do you read
Words
What is the matter
Between who?
I mean
Slanders
that old men have grey beards
wrinkled
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down
yourself
you could go backward.
[Aside]  Though this be madness
in 't. Will you walk out of the air
Into my grave.
Indeed
Aside
How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
that often madness hits on

My most dear lord!
My excellent good friends! How dost thou
As the indifferent children of the earth.

Denmark's a prison.

A goodly one; in which there are many confines

A dream itself is but a shadow.

Beggar that I am

too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come
What should we say
Why
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
To what end
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you
the rights of our fellowship
our youth
love
charge you withal
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
[Aside]  Nay
love me
My lord
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame
earth

o'erhanging firmament

What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet
me: no
you seem to say so.
My lord
Why did you laugh then
To think
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
coming
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
say her mind freely
for't. What players are they?
Even those you were wont to take delight in
tragedians of the city.
How chances it they travel? their residence
in reputation and profit
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
in the city? are they so followed?
No
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
Nay
there is
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
fashion
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
What
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? will they not say
afterwards
players--as it is most like
better--their writers do them wrong
exclaim against their own succession?
'Faith
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy: there was
for argument
cuffs in the question.
Is't possible?
O
Do the boys carry it away?
Ay
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of

What speech
I heard thee speak me a speech once
never acted; or
play
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
it
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play
digested in the scenes
modesty as cunning. I remember
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury
indict the author of affectation; but called it an
honest method
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
thereabout of it especially
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory
at this line: let me see
'The rugged Pyrrhus
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
'The rugged Pyrrhus
When he lay couched in the ominous horse
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
With blood of fathers
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
So
'Fore God
good discretion.
'Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium
Stoops to his base
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for
Of reverend Priam
So
But
As hush as death
Doth rend the region
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam.

This is too long.

With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood

But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs

With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!

What's Hecuba to him
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?

Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat

That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea
Out of my weakness and my melancholy
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
That patient merit of the unworthy takes
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear
No traveller returns
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought
With this regard their currents turn awry

force of honesty can translate beauty into his

time gives it proof. I did love you once.
Indeed
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of

And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger: which for to prevent
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love. How now
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. My lord
But
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief: let her be round with him;

offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters
very rags

And could of men distinguish
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave
In my heart's core
There is a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face
In censure of his seeming.

My operant powers their functions leave to do:
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind
For husband shalt thou--

In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift
A second time I kill my husband dead
I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory
Which now

To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels
Grief joys
This world is not for aye
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove
The great man down
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend
But
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
Nor earth to me give food
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
If she should break it now!

The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone; but
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which
Did the king sigh
Arm you
For we will fetters put upon this fear
We will haste us.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
Enter POLONIUS
My lord
Behind the arras I'll convey myself
And
The speech
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
Thanks
Exit POLONIUS
O
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force
My fault is past. But
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
There is no shuffling
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul
Bow
All may be well.
Retires and kneels
Enter HAMLET
Now might I do it pat
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
A villain kills my father; and for that
To heaven.
O
He took my father grossly
With all his crimes broad blown
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought
No!
Up
When he is drunk asleep
At gaming
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Then trip him
As hell
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
Exit
[Rising]  My words fly up
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you
[Within]  Mother
I'll warrant you
POLONIUS hides behind the arras
Enter HAMLET
Now
Hamlet
Mother
Come
Go
Why
What's the matter now?
Have you forgot me?
No
You are the queen
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
Nay
Come
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Help
[Behind]  What
[Drawing]  How now! a rat? Dead
Makes a pass through the arras
[Behind]  O
Falls and dies
O me
Nay
Is it the king?
O
A bloody deed! almost as bad
As kill a king!
Ay
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS
Thou wretched
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
What have I done
In noise so rude against me?
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there
As false as dicers' oaths: O
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Yea
Ay me
Look here
See
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed
This was your husband. Look you now
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame
Would step from this to this? Sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err
But it reserved some quantity of choice
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge
And reason panders will.
O Hamlet
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.
Nay
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
Over the nasty sty
O
These words
No more
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule
No more!
A king of shreds and patches
Enter Ghost
Save me
Alas
Do you not come your tardy son to chide
The important acting of your dread command? O
Do not forget: this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But
O
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Speak to her
How is it with you
Alas
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
On him
His form and cause conjoin'd
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects: then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
To whom do you speak this?
Do you see nothing there?
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Nor did you nothing hear?
No
Why
My father
Look
Exit Ghost
This the very coinage of your brain:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.
Ecstasy!
My pulse
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test
Would gambol from. Mother
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spread the compost on the weeds
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
O Hamlet
O
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Assume a virtue
That monster
He likewise gives a frock or livery
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature
With wondrous potency. Once more
And when you are desirous to be bless'd
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so
I will bestow him
The death I gave him. So
I must be cruel
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more
What shall I do?
Not this
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
And let him
For who
No
Let the birds fly
Be thou assured
What thou hast said to me.
I must to England; you know that?
Alack
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines
This man shall set me packing:
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother
Is now most still
Come
Good night

Mad as the sea and wind
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit
And
The unseen good old man.
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us
His liberty is full of threats to all;
To you yourself
Alas
It will be laid to us
Should have kept short
But
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
O'er whom his very madness
Among a mineral of metals base
O Gertrude
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
We must

Compounded it with dust
Tell us where 'tis

SCENE III. Another room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS
I have sent to seek him
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He's loved of the distracted multitude
And where tis so
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved
Enter ROSENCRANTZ
How now! what hath befall'n?
Where the dead body is bestow'd
But where is he?
Without
Bring him before us.
Ho
Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN
Now
At supper.
At supper! where?
Not where he eats
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service
that's the end.
Alas
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king
What dost you mean by this?
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar.
Where is Polonius?
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger

How purposed
Against some part of Poland.

That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate

How all occasions do inform against me
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast
Sure
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now
Bestial oblivion
Of thinking too precisely on the event
And ever three parts coward
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince
Makes mouths at the invisible event
To all that fortune
Is not to stir without great argument
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then
The imminent death of twenty thousand men
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
To hide the slain? O

I will not speak with her.
She is importunate
Her mood will needs be pitied.
What would she have?
She speaks much of her father; says she hears
There's tricks i' the world; and hems
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt
The hearers to collection; they aim at it
Which

'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee

A sister driven into desperate terms
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:

'High and mighty
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see

What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse
Know you the hand?
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
And in a postscript here
Can you advise me?
I'm lost in it
It warms the very sickness in my heart
If it be so
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
Will you be ruled by me?
Ay
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
No more to undertake it
To an exploit
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
And call it accident.
My lord
The rather
That I might be the organ.
It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much
Wherein
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one
What part is that
A very riband in the cap of youth
The light and careless livery that it wears
Than settled age his sables and his weeds
I've seen myself
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
A Norman was't?
A Norman.
Upon my life
The very same.
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation.
He made confession of you
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming o'er
Now
What out of this
Laertes
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow
Why ask you this?
Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is begun by time;
And that I see
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
For goodness
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake
More than in words?
To cut his throat i' the church.
No place
Revenge should have no bounds. But
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you
And wager on your heads: he
A sword unbated
Requite him for your father.
I will do't:
And
I bought an unction of a mountebank
Under the moon
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
With this contagion
Let's further think of this;
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail
Should have a back or second
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
When in your motion you are hot and dry--
As make your bouts more violent to that end--

How now
One woe doth tread upon another's heel
Drown'd! O
There is a willow grows aslant a brook
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crow-flowers
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name
There
Clambering to hang
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments
To muddy death.
Alas
Drown'd
Too much of water hast thou
It is our trick; nature her custom holds
I have a speech of fire

ACT V
SCENE I. A churchyard.
Enter two Clowns
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
wilfully seeks her own salvation?
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
straight: the crowner hath sat on her
Christian burial.
How can that be
own defence?
Why
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly
is
herself wittingly.
Nay
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water
goes
and drown him
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
But is this law?
Ay
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
a gentlewoman
Christian burial.
Why
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves
Christian. Come
gentleman but gardeners
they hold up Adam's profession.
Was he a gentleman?
He was the first that ever bore arms.
Why
What
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
could he dig without arms? I'll put another
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
purpose
Go to.
What is he that builds stronger than either the
mason
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants.
I like thy wit well
does well; but how does it well? it does well to
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal
'Who builds stronger than a mason
a carpenter?'
Ay
Marry
To't.

Throws up another skull
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a

suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
in's time a great buyer of land
the recovery of his recoveries
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more
Not a jot more
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Ay
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
grave's this

For no man
What woman
For none
Who is to be buried in't?
One that was a woman
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
card
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
grave-maker?
Of all the days i' the year
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
How long is that since?
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
is mad
Ay
Why
there; or
Why?
'Twill
are as mad as he.
How came he mad?
Very strangely
How strangely?
Faith
Upon what ground?
Why
and boy
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
I' faith
have many pocky corses now-a-days
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
Why he more than another?
Why
he will keep out water a great while; and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years.
Whose was it?
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
Nay
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull

E'en that.

Takes the skull
Alas
of infinite jest
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at

not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment
now
Now get you to my lady's chamber

What's that
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
the earth?
E'en so.
And smelt so? pah!
Puts down the skull

To what base uses we may return

Retiring with HORATIO
What ceremony else?
That is Laertes
What ceremony else?
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
And
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants
Of bell and burial.
Must there no more be done?
No more be done:
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
As to peace-parted souls.
Lay her i' the earth:
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring! I tell thee
What
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
Scattering flowers
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd
O
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile
Leaps into the grave
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
Of blue Olympus.
[Advancing]     What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wandering stars
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I
Leaps into the grave

Thou pray'st not well.

Good my lord
The Attendants part them

Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
O my son
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
Could not

For love of God
'Swounds
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her
And
Millions of acres on us
This is mere madness:
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;

What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
Let Hercules himself do what he may

So much for this
You do remember all the circumstance?
Remember it
Sir
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly
There's a divinity that shapes our ends
That is most certain.
Up from my cabin
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
Finger'd their packet
To mine own room again; making so bold
Their grand commission; where I found
O royal knavery!--an exact command
Importing Denmark's health and England's too
Is't possible?
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
I beseech you.
Being thus be-netted round with villanies
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains
I once did hold it
How to forget that learning
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?
Ay
An earnest conjuration from the king
And stand a comma 'tween their amities
How was this seal'd?
Why
I had my father's signet in my purse
Folded the writ up in form of the other
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Thou know'st already.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
Why
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.
Why
Does it not
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother
In further evil?
It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.
It will be short: the interim is mine;
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
But I am very sorry
For
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.

Into a towering passion.

You will do't

Of Laertes?
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.

You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--

This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
He did comply with his dug
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I

The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
She well instructs me.

You will lose this wager
I do not think so: since he went into France

Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away
Who does it
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
I am satisfied in nature
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement
I embrace it freely;
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.
Come
I'll be your foil
Your skill shall
You mock me
No
Give them the foils
Very well
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
But since he is better'd
This is too heavy
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
They prepare to play
Ay
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
And in the cup an union shall he throw

Where should we have our thanks?

SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
My lord
Was like
Did push it out of farther question.
But how
It must be thought on. If it pass against us
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the church
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
As much as would maintain
And
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
And to the coffers of the king beside
This would drink deep.
'Twould drink the cup and all.
But what prevention?
The king is full of grace and fair regard.
And a true lover of the holy church.
The courses of his youth promised it not.
The breath no sooner left his father's body
Consideration
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him
Never was such a sudden scholar made;
Never came reformation in a flood
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this king.
We are blessed in the change.
Hear him but reason in divinity
You would desire the king were made a prelate:
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
List his discourse of war
A fearful battle render'd you in music:
Turn him to any cause of policy
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric:
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it
From open haunts and popularity.
The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
And so the prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildness; which
It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected.
But
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
Incline to it
He seems indifferent
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
For I have made an offer to his majesty
And in regard of causes now in hand
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal.
How did this offer seem received
With good acceptance of his majesty;
Save that there was not time enough to hear
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
Derived from Edward
What was the impediment that broke this off?
The French ambassador upon that instant
Craved audience; and the hour
To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
It is.
Then go we in
Which I could with a ready guess declare
I'll wait upon you
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.

Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
Not here in presence.
Send for him
Shall we call in the ambassador
Not yet
That task our thoughts
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it!
Sure
My learned lord
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique that they have in France
Or should
And God forbid
With opening titles miscreate
Suits not in native colours with the truth;
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person
We charge you
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe
'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
That make such waste in brief mortality.
Under this conjuration
For we will hear
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
As pure as sin with baptism.
Then hear me
To this imperial throne. There is no bar
To make against your highness' claim to France
But this
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France
The founder of this law and female bar.
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany
Where Charles the Great
Who
For some dishonest manners of their life
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
Which Salique
Then doth it well appear that Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France:
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond
Who died within the year of our redemption
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
Subdued the Saxons
Beyond the river Sala
Eight hundred five. Besides
Of Blithild
Hugh Capet also
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great
To Lewis the emperor
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth
That fair Queen Isabel
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
Was re-united to the crown of France.
So that
King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim
To hold in right and title of the female:
So do the kings of France unto this day;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your highness claiming from the female
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
May I with right and conscience make this claim?
The sin upon my head
For in the book of Numbers is it writ
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord
Look back into your mighty ancestors:
Go
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
Forage in blood of French nobility.
O noble English. that could entertain
With half their forces the full Pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
The blood and courage that renowned them
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
Is in the very May-morn of his youth
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself
They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
So hath your highness; never king of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
O
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors.
We must not only arm to invade the French
Against the Scot
With all advantages.
They of those marches
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
We do not mean the coursing snatchers only
For you shall read that my great-grandfather
Never went with his forces into France
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
Came pouring
That England
She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd
For hear her but exampled by herself:
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.
But there's a saying very old and true
For once the eagle England being in prey
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
It follows then the cat must stay at home:
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad
For government
Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions
To which is fixed
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
They have a king and officers of sorts;
Where some
To the tent-royal of their emperor;
Who
The singing masons building roofs of gold
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer
To one consent
As many arrows
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
As many lines close in the dial's centre;
So may a thousand actions
End in one purpose
Without defeat. Therefore to France
Divide your happy England into four;
Whereof take you one quarter into France

Exeunt some Attendants
Now are we well resolved; and
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms
Either our history shall with full mouth
Speak freely of our acts
Enter Ambassadors of France
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
Your greeting is from him
May't please your majesty to give us leave
Freely to render what we have in charge;
Or shall we sparingly show you far off
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
We are no tyrant
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
Thus
Your highness
Of your great predecessor
In answer of which claim
Says that you savour too much of your youth
That can be with a nimble galliard won;
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
He therefore sends you
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
What treasure
Tennis-balls
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
His present and your pains we thank you for:
When we have march'd our rackets to these balls
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
With chaces. And we understand him well
We never valued this poor seat of England;
And therefore
To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
That men are merriest when they are from home.
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
For that I have laid by my majesty
And plodded like a man for working-days
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
Mock mothers from their sons
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savour but of shallow wit
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
Exeunt Ambassadors
This was a merry message.
We hope to make the sender blush at it.
Therefore
That may give furtherance to our expedition;
For we have now no thought in us but France
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Be soon collected and all things thought upon
That may with reasonable swiftness add
More feathers to our wings; for
Therefore let every man now task his thought

As if allegiance in their bosoms sat
The king hath note of all that they intend
Nay
His sovereign's life to death and treachery.
Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V
Now sits the wind fair
My Lord of Cambridge
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France
For which we have in head assembled them?
No doubt
I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
We carry not a heart with us from hence
That grows not in a fair consent with ours
Success and conquest to attend on us.
Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
Than is your majesty: there's not
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
Under the sweet shade of your government.
True: those that were your father's enemies
Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
And shall forget the office of our hand
According to the weight and worthiness.
So service shall with steeled sinews toil
We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter
it was excess of wine that set him on;
And on his more advice we pardon him.
That's mercy
Let him be punish'd
Breed
O
So may your highness
Sir
Alas
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
If little faults
When capital crimes
And tender preservation of our person
Who are the late commissioners?
I one
Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.
So did you me
And I
Then
There yours
Read them; and know
My Lord of Westmoreland
What see you in those papers that you lose
So much complexion? Look ye
Their cheeks are paper. Why
That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
Out of appearance?
I do confess my fault;
And do submit me to your highness' mercy.
To which we all appeal.
The mercy that was quick in us but late
You must not dare
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
See you
To furnish him with all appertinents
Belonging to his honour; and this man
Hath
This knight
Than Cambridge is
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange
As black and white
Treason and murder ever kept together
But thou
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
All other devils that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle up damnation
With patches
From glistering semblances of piety;
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
O
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
Why
Why
Why
Why
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
For this revolt of thine
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
Arrest them to the answer of the law;
And God acquit them of their practises!
I arrest thee of high treason
Richard Earl of Cambridge.
I arrest thee of high treason
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
I arrest thee of high treason
Thomas Grey
Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;
And I repent my fault more than my death;
Which I beseech your highness to forgive
For me
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended:
But God be thanked for prevention;
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice
Never did faithful subject more rejoice
At the discovery of most dangerous treason
Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.
Prevented from a damned enterprise:
My fault
God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
You have conspired against our royal person
Received the golden earnest of our death;
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
Touching our person seek we no revenge;
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence
The taste whereof
You patience to endure
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.
Exeunt CAMBRIDGE
Now
Shall be to you
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war
This dangerous treason lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
But every rub is smoothed on our way.

Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING
Thus comes the English with full power upon us;
And more than carefully it us concerns
To answer royally in our defences.
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne
With men of courage and with means defendant;
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
It fits us then to be as provident
As fear may teach us out of late examples
Left by the fatal and neglected English
Upon our fields.
My most redoubted father
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
Therefore
To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
And let us do it with no show of fear;
No
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
For
By a vain
O peace
You are too much mistaken in this king:
Question your grace the late ambassadors
How terrible in constant resolution
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate.
Well
But though we think it so
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
The enemy more mighty than he seems:
So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
Which of a weak or niggardly projection
Doth
A little cloth.
Think we King Harry strong;
And
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
That haunted us in our familiar paths:
Witness our too much memorable shame
When Cressy battle fatally was struck
Of that black name
Whiles that his mountain sire
The patterns that by God and by French fathers
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
The native mightiness and fate of him.
Enter a Messenger
Ambassadors from Harry King of England
Do crave admittance to your majesty.
We'll give them present audience. Go
Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords
You see this chase is hotly follow'd
Turn head
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
Runs far before them. Good my sovereign
Of what a monarchy you are the head:
Self-love
As self-neglecting.
Re-enter Lords
From our brother England?
From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
He wills you
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven
To him and to his heirs; namely
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
By custom and the ordinance of times
Unto the crown of France. That you may know
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim
Willing to overlook this pedigree:
And when you find him evenly derived
From his most famed of famous ancestors
Your crown and kingdom
From him the native and true challenger.
Or else what follows?
Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
And bids you
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
Turning the widows' tears
The dead men's blood
This is his claim
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here
For us
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
Back to our brother England.
For the Dauphin
Scorn and defiance; slight regard
The mighty sender
Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness
Do not
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
In second accent of his ordnance.
Say
Nothing but odds with England: to that end
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it
And
And these he masters now: now he weighs time
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
In your own losses
To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.
Dispatch us with all speed
Come here himself to question our delay;
For he is footed in this land already.
You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:
A night is but small breath and little pause
To answer matters of this consequence.

PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:
Play with your fancies
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails
You stand upon the ravage and behold
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
For so appears this fleet majestical
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
For who is he
With one appearing hair
These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Work
Behold the ordnance on their carriages
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
Katharine his daughter
The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches
And down goes all before them. Still be kind
Exit

Alarum. Enter KING HENRY
Once more unto the breach
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears
Stiffen the sinews
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
To his full height. On
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
Fathers that
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
For there is none of you so mean and base
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
Follow your spirit
Cry 'God for Harry

The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:
Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;

all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.
And I:
If wishes would prevail with me

Exeunt all but Boy
As young as I am

a man. For Bardolph
red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out
fights not. For Pistol
and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks
words
heard that men of few words are the best men; and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never
broke any man's head but his own
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
any thing
lute-case
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals. They would have me as
familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood
mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
must leave them
their villany goes against my weak stomach
therefore I must cast it up.

How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit;
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;
Or like to men proud of destruction
Defy us to our worst: for
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up
With conscience wide as hell
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.
What is it then to me
Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
What is't to me
Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
As send precepts to the leviathan
To come ashore. Therefore
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
Of heady murder
If not
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
Your fathers taken by the silver beards
Do break the clouds
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
What say you? will you yield
Our expectation hath this day an end:
The Dauphin
To raise so great a siege. Therefore
Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;
For we no longer are defensible.
Open your gates. Come
Use mercy to them all. For us

Unfought withal
In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?
Is not their climate foggy
And shall our quick blood

Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
Poor we may call them in their native lords.
By faith and honour
Our mettle is bred out and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
To new-store France with bastard warriors.

committed at the bridge.
Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;
and a man that I love and honour with my soul

my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and
blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the
bridge most valiantly
There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
pridge
valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no
estimation in the world; but did see him do as
gallant service.
What do you call him?
He is called Aunchient Pistol.
I know him not.
Enter PISTOL
Here is the man.

The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
Ay

Fortune is an excellent moral.
Fortune is Bardolph's foe
For he hath stolen a pax
A damned death!
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:
But Exeter hath given the doom of death
For pax of little price.
Therefore
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
Speak
Aunchient Pistol
Why then
Certainly
at: for if
desire the duke to use his good pleasure
him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.
Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!
It is well.
The fig of Spain!
Exit
Very good.
Why
remember him now; a bawd
I'll assure you
bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it
is very well; what he has spoke to me
Why
goes to the wars
into London under the form of a soldier. And such
fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:
and they will learn you by rote where services were
done; at such and such a sconce
shot
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war
a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of
the camp will do among foaming bottles and
ale-washed wits
you must learn to know such slanders of the age
else you may be marvellously mistook.
I tell you what
not the man that he would gladly make show to the
world he is: if I find a hole in his coat
tell him my mind.
Drum heard
Hark you
him from the pridge.
Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY

very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is
gone off
prave passages; marry
possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to
retire
pridge: I can tell your majesty
prave man.
What men have you lost
The perdition of th' athversary hath been very
great
think the duke hath lost never a man
is like to be executed for robbing a church
Bardolph
all bubukles
fire: and his lips blows at his nose
a coal of fire
but his nose is executed and his fire's out.
We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we
give express charge

gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
Tucket. Enter MONTJOY
You know me by my habit.
Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?
My master's mind.
Unfold it.
Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:
Though we seemed dead
is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we
could have rebuked him at Harfleur
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue
is imperial: England shall repent his folly
his weakness
therefore consider of his ransom; which must
proportion the losses we have borne
have lost
weight to re-answer
For our losses
effusion of our blood
faint a number; and for our disgrace
person
worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and
tell him
followers
my king and master; so much my office.
What is thy name? I know thy quality.
Montjoy.
Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;
But could be willing to march on to Calais
Without impeachment: for
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage
Almost no better than so many French;
Who when they were in health
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet
Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.
Go therefore
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
Yet
Stand in our way. There's for thy labour
Go bid thy master well advise himself:
If we may pass
Discolour: and so Montjoy
The sum of all our answer is but this:
We would not seek a battle
Nor
So tell your master.
I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.

SCENE VII. The French camp
Enter the Constable of France
Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!
You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.
It is the best horse of Europe.
Will it never be morning?
My lord of Orleans
talk of horse and armour?
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
What a long night is this! I will not change my
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
Ca
entrails were hairs; le cheval volant
soar
sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
He's of the colour of the nutmeg.
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
elements of earth and water never appear in him
only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
may call beasts.
Indeed
It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.
No more
Nay
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb
deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as
fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent
tongues
'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on
a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the
world
their particular functions and wonder at him. I
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:
'Wonder of nature
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my
courser
Your mistress bears well.
Me well; which is the prescript praise and
perfection of a good and particular mistress.
Nay
shook your back.
So perhaps did yours.
Mine was not bridled.
O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode
your straight strossers.
You have good judgment in horsemanship.
Be warned by me
not warily
my horse to my mistress.
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
I tell thee
I could make as true a boast as that
to my mistress.
'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement
la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress
such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
My lord constable
to-night
Stars
Some of them will fall to-morrow
And yet my sky shall not want.
That may be
'twere more honour some were away.
Even as your horse bears your praises; who would
trot as well
Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will
it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile
my way shall be paved with English faces.
I will not say so
my way: but I would it were morning; for I would
fain be about the ears of the English.
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
You must first go yourself to hazard
'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.
Exit
The Dauphin longs for morning.
He longs to eat the English.
I think he will eat all he kills.
By the white hand of my lady
Swear by her foot
He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.
He never did harm
Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.
I know him to be valiant.
I was told that  by one that knows him better than
you.
What's he?
Marry
not who knew it
He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.
By my faith
but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it
appears
Ill will never said well.
I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'
And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'
Well placed: there stands your friend for the
devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A
pox of the devil.'
You are the better at proverbs
fool's bolt is soon shot.'
You have shot over.
'Tis not the first time you were overshot.
Enter a Messenger
My lord high constable
fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
Who hath measured the ground?
The Lord Grandpre.
A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were
day! Alas
the dawning as we do.
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
England
far out of his knowledge!
If the English had any apprehension
That they lack; for if their heads had any
intellectual armour
head-pieces.
That island of England breeds very valiant

Foolish curs
Russian bear and have their heads crushed like
rotten apples! You may as well say
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
Just
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on
their wits with their wives: and then give them
great meals of beef and iron and steel
eat like wolves and fight like devils.
Ay
Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs
to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:
come
It is now two o'clock: but
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.

Enter Chorus
Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
The hum of either army stilly sounds
The secret whispers of each other's watch:
Fire answers fire
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
Steed threatens steed
Piercing the night's dull ear
The armourers
The country cocks do crow
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul
Do the low-rated English play at dice;
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
Who
So tediously away. The poor condemned English
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The morning's danger
Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts. O now
The royal captain of this ruin'd band
Walking from watch to watch
For forth he goes and visits all his host.
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
And calls them brothers
Upon his royal face there is no note
How dread an army hath enrounded him;
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
Unto the weary and all-watched night
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
That every wretch
A largess universal like the sun
His liberal eye doth give to every one
And so our scene must to the battle fly;
Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
With four or five most vile and ragged foils

Good morrow
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France.

Upon example; so the spirit is eased:
And when the mind is quicken'd
Lend me thy cloak
Do my good morrow to them
Desire them an to my pavilion.

Under what captain serve you?
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I
pray you
Even as men wrecked upon a sand
washed off the next tide.
He hath not told his thought to the king?
No; nor it is not meet he should. For
speak it to you
am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the
element shows to him as it doth to me; all his
senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies
laid by
though his affections are higher mounted than ours
wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears
do
as ours are: yet

He may show what outward courage he will; but I
believe

Then I would he were here alone; so should he be

contented as in the king's company; his cause being
just and his quarrel honourable.
That's more than we know.
Ay
enough
his cause be wrong
the crime of it out of us.
But if the cause be not good
a heavy reckoning to make
arms and heads
together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at
such a place;' some swearing

well that die in a battle; for how can they
charitably dispose of any thing

will be a black matter for the king that led them to
it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of
subjection.
So

imputation of his wickedness by your rule
imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
servant

damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers

they purpose their services. Besides
king

unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;
some
perjury; some
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
pillage and robbery. Now
defeated the law and outrun native punishment
fly from God: war is his beadle
so that here men are punished for before-breach of
the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
they feared the death
and where they would be safe
they die unprovided
their damnation than he was before guilty of those
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
the wars do as every sick man in his bed
mote out of his conscience: and dying so
is to him advantage; or not dying
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
and in him that escapes
that
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare.
'Tis certain

But I do not desire he should answer for me; and
yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
Ay

If I live to see it
You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an
elder-gun
do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
after! come
Your reproof is something too round: I should be
angry with you
Let it be a quarrel between us
I embrace it.
How shall I know thee again?
Give me any gage of thine
bonnet: then
will make it my quarrel.
Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
There.
This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come

If ever I live to see it
Thou darest as well be hanged.
Well. I will do it

But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease
Must kings neglect
And what have kings
And what art thou
What kind of god art thou
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
O ceremony
What is thy soul of adoration?
Art thou aught else but place
Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
Than they in fearing.
What drink'st thou oft
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
With titles blown from adulation?
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
Canst thou
I am a king that find thee
'Tis not the balm

And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears

To give each naked curtle-axe a stain

About our squares of battle
To purge this field of such a hilding foe
Took stand for idle speculation:
But that our honours must not. What's to say?
A very little little let us do.

The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
For our approach shall so much dare the field
That England shall couch down in fear and yield.

Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
Lob down their heads
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
Lies foul with chew'd grass
And their executors
Description cannot suit itself in words
To demonstrate the life of such a battle
In life so lifeless as it shows itself.
They have said their prayers
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
And give their fasting horses provender
I stay but for my guidon: to the field!

That do no work to-day!
What's he that wishes so?
My cousin Westmoreland? No
If we are mark'd to die
To do our country loss; and if to live
God's will! I pray thee
By Jove
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
But if it be a sin to covet honour
No
God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
As one man more
For the best hope I have. O
Rather proclaim it
And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
We would not die in that man's company
That fears his fellowship to die with us.
This day is called the feast of Crispian:
He that outlives this day
He that shall live this day
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot
What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
Familiar in his mouth as household words
Harry the king
This story shall the good man teach his son;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by
We few
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

I pray thee
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?

Find native graves; upon the which
And those that leave their valiant bones in France
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
Mark then abounding valour in our English
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable
We are but warriors for the working-day;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
With rainy marching in the painful field;
There's not a piece of feather in our host--
Good argument
And time hath worn us into slovenry:
But
And my poor soldiers tell me
They'll be in fresher robes
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
And turn them out of service. If they do this

Will soon be levied. Herald

But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.

I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;
From helmet to the spur all blood he was.
In which array
Suffolk first died: and York
That bloodily did spawn upon his face;
And cries aloud 'Tarry
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
Tarry
We kept together in our chivalry!'
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:
He smiled me in the face
So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
And so espoused to death
A testament of noble-ending love.
The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
But I had not so much of man in me
And gave me up to tears.
I blame you not;

gallant king!
Ay
call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!
Alexander the Great.

I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his
father was called Philip of Macedon
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I
tell you

Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at
Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is
out of my prains what is the name of the other
river; but 'tis all one

mark Alexander's life well
is come after it indifferent well; for there is
figures in all things. Alexander
you know
wraths
displeasures
little intoxicates in his prains
his angers
Our king is not like him in that: he never killed
any of his friends.
It is not well done
of my mouth
but in the figures and comparisons of it: as
Alexander killed his friend Cleitus
ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth
his right wits and his good judgments

was full of jests
mocks; I have forgot his name.

How now! what means this
That I have  fined these bones of mine for ransom?
Comest thou again for ransom?
No
I come to thee for charitable licence
To look our dead
To sort our nobles from our common men.
For many of our princes--woe the while!--
Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds
Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters
Of their dead bodies!
I tell thee truly
For yet a many of your horsemen peer
And gallop o'er the field.

To boast of this or take the praise from God
Which is his only.

yourself and all the world know to be no petter

come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday
where I could not breed no contention with him; but
I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see
him once again
piece of my desires.
Enter PISTOL
Why
'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his
turkey-cocks. God pless you

Ha! art thou bedlam? dost thou thirst
Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.
I peseech you heartily

love it
your digestions doo's not agree with it
desire you to eat it.
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
There is one goat for you.

Will you be so good
Base Trojan
You say very true
I will desire you to live in the mean time
your victuals: come
Strikes him
You called me yesterday mountain-squire; but I will
make you to-day a squire of low degree. I pray you
Enough
I say
I will peat his pate four days. Bite
is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.
Must I bite?
Yes
too
By this leek
and eat
Eat
your leek? there is not enough leek to swear by.
Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.
Much good do you
you
broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see leeks
hereafter
Good.
Ay
heal your pate.
Me a groat!
Yes
have another leek in my pocket
I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.
If I owe you any thing
you shall be a woodmonger
cudgels. God b' wi' you
Exit
All hell shall stir for this.
Go
you mock at an ancient tradition
honourable respect
predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds
any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and
galling at this gentleman twice or thrice. You
thought
native garb
English cudgel: you find it otherwise; and
henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good
English condition. Fare ye well.
Exit
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?
News have I
Of malady of France;
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
Old I do wax; and from my weary limbs
Honour is cudgelled. Well
To England will I steal
And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars

SCENE II. France. A royal palace.
Enter
Peace to this meeting
Unto our brother France
To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;
And
And
Right joyous are we to behold your face
So are you
So happy be the issue
Your eyes
Against the French
The venom of such looks
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
To cry amen to that
You English princes all
My duty to you both
Unto this bar and royal interview
Since then my office hath so far prevail'd
That
Our fertile France
Alas
Her vine
The darnel
Doth root upon
That should deracinate such savagery;
The even mead
The freckled cowslip
But hateful docks
And as our vineyards
Have lost
But grow like savages
That nothing do but meditate on blood
To swearing and stern looks
And every thing that seems unnatural.
Which to reduce into our former favour
You are assembled: and my speech entreats
That I may know the let
Should not expel these inconveniences
And bless us with her former qualities.
If
Which you have cited
With full accord to all our just demands;
Whose tenors and particular effects
You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
The king hath heard them; to the which as yet
There is no answer made.
Well then the peace
I have but with a cursorary eye
O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace
To appoint some of your council presently
To sit with us once more
To re-survey them
Pass our accept and peremptory answer.
Brother
And take with you free power to ratify
Shall see advantageable for our dignity
Our gracious brother
Haply a woman's voice may do some good
Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:
She is our capital demand
Within the fore-rank of our articles.
She hath good leave.
Exeunt all except HENRY
Fair Katharine
Such as will enter at a lady's ear
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katharine
your French heart
confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do
you like me
Pardonnez-moi
An angel is like you
Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?
Oui
I said so
affirm it.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de
tromperies.
What says she
are full of deceits?
Oui
deceits: dat is de princess.
The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith
glad thou canst speak no better English; for
thou couldst
that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my
crown. I know no ways to mince it in love
directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me
farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out
my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith
clap hands and a bargain: how say you
Sauf votre honneur
Marry
your sake
have neither words nor measure
have no strength in measure
measure in strength. If I could win a lady at
leap-frog
armour on my back
be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.
Or if I might buffet for my love
for her favours
sit like a jack-an-apes
eloquence
only downright oaths
fellow of this temper
sun-burning
of any thing he sees there
cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst
love me for this
that I shall die
Lord
livest
uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee
right
places: for these fellows of infinite tongue
can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours
always reason themselves out again. What! a
speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A
good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a
black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow
bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax
hollow: but a good heart
moon; or
shines bright and never changes
course truly. If thou would have such a one
me; and take me
speak
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of
France
the friend of France; for I love France so well that
I will not part with a village of it; I will have it
all mine: and
yours
I cannot tell vat is dat.
No
sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married
wife about her husband's neck
off. Je quand sur le possession de France
vous avez le possession de moi
then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est
France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me
more French: I shall never move thee in French
Sauf votre honneur
est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.
No
tongue
be granted to be much at one. But
understand thus much English
I cannot tell.
Can any of your neighbours tell
them. Come
gentlewoman about me; and I know
her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
your heart: but
rather
cruelly. If ever thou beest mine
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt
thee with scambling
prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I
boy
Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
shall we not? what sayest thou
flower-de-luce?
I do not know dat
No; 'tis hereafter to know
but now promise
French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety
take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer
you
et devin deesse?
Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
Now
true English
dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to
flatter me that thou dost
and untempering effect of my visage. Now
my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars
when he got me: therefore was I created with a
stubborn outside
I come to woo ladies
my comfort is
beauty
hast me
shalt wear me
and therefore tell me
have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;
take me by the hand
thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
ear withal
thine
Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before
his face
Come
music and thy English broken; therefore
all
English; wilt thou have me?
Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
Nay
him
Den it sall also content me.
Upon that I kiss your hand
Laissez
ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en
baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne
serviteur; excusez-moi
tres-puissant seigneur.
Then I will kiss your lips
Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
leur noces
Madam my interpreter
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
France
To kiss.
Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.
It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss
before they are married
Oui
O Kate
Kate
list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of
manners
places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will
do yours
country in denying me a kiss: therefore
and yielding.
Kissing her
You have witchcraft in your lips
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
tongues of the French council; and they should
sooner persuade Harry of England than a general
petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.
Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN
God save your majesty! my royal cousin
our princess English?
I would have her learn
perfectly I love her; and that is good English.
Is she not apt?
Our tongue is rough
smooth; so that
heart of flattery about me
the spirit of love in her
his true likeness.
Pardon the frankness of my mirth
for that. If you would conjure in her
make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true
likeness
blame her then
virgin crimson of modesty
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
self? It were
to consign to.
Yet they do wink and yield
They are then excused
what they do.
Then
I will wink on her to consent
teach her to know my meaning: for maids
summered and warm kept
Bartholomew-tide
eyes; and then they will endure handling
before would not abide looking on.
This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;
and so I shall catch the fly
latter end and she must be blind too.
As love is
It is so: and you may
my blindness
for one fair French maid that stands in my way.
Yes
turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with
maiden walls that war hath never entered.
Shall Kate be my wife?
So please you.
I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may
wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for
my wish shall show me the way to my will.
We have consented to all terms of reason.
Is't so
The king hath granted every article:
His daughter first
Only he hath not yet subscribed this:
Where your majesty demands
addition in French
d'Angleterre
Latin
Angliae
Nor this I have not
I pray you then
And thereupon give me your daughter.
Take her
Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms
Of France and England
With envy of each other's happiness
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
In their sweet bosoms
His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.
Amen!
Now
Flourish
God
As man and wife
That English may as French
Amen!
Prepare we for our marriage--on which day
Then shall I swear to Kate
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!

ACT I
PROLOGUE
I come no more to make you laugh: things now
May
The subject will deserve it. Such as give
Their money out of hope they may believe
Only a show or two
The play may pass
Richly in two short hours. Only they
That come to hear a merry bawdy play
In a long motley coat guarded with yellow
As fool and fight is
Our own brains
Therefore
The first and happiest hearers of the town
The very persons of our noble story
As they were living; think you see them great
Of thousand friends; then in a moment
How soon this mightiness meets misery:
And
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the palace.
Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other
Good morrow
Since last we saw in France?
I thank your grace
Of what I saw there.
An untimely ague
Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
Those suns of glory
'Twixt Guynes and Arde:
I was then present
Beheld them
In their embracement
Which had they
Such a compounded one?
All the whole time
I was my chamber's prisoner.
Then you lost
The view of earthly glory: men might say
To one above itself. Each following day
Became the next day's master
Made former wonders its. To-day the French
Made Britain India: every man that stood
Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
As cherubins
The pride upon them
Was to them as a painting: now this masque
Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night
Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings
'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner
Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
The noble spirits to arms
Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story
O
As I belong to worship and affect
In honour honesty
Would by a good discourser lose some life
To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.
Order gave each thing view; the office did
Distinctly his full function.
Who did guide
Of this great sport together
One
In such a business.
I pray you
All this was order'd by the good discretion
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.
The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
From his ambitious finger. What had he
To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
That such a keech can with his very bulk
Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun
And keep it from the earth.
Surely
For
Chalks successors their way
For high feats done to the crown; neither allied
For eminent assistants; but
A gift that heaven gives for him
A place next to the king.
I cannot tell
What heaven hath given him
Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
Peep through each part of him: whence has he that
A new hell in himself.
Why the devil
Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
Of all the gentry; for the most part such
To whom as great a charge as little honour
He meant to lay upon: and his own letter
I do know
Kinsmen of mine
By this so sickened their estates
They shall abound as formerly.
O
Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
For this great journey. What did this vanity
But minister communication of
A most poor issue?
Grievingly I think
The cost that did conclude it.
Every man
A thing inspired; and
Into a general prophecy; That this tempest
The sudden breach on't.
Which is budded out;
For France hath flaw'd the league
Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.
Is it therefore
The ambassador is silenced?
Marry
A proper title of a peace; and purchased
At a superfluous rate!
Why
Our reverend cardinal carried.
Like it your grace
Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Honour and plenteous safety--that you read
The cardinal's malice and his potency
Together; to consider further that
What his high hatred would effect wants not
A minister in his power. You know his nature
Hath a sharp edge: it's long and
That I advise your shunning.
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY
The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor
Where's his examination?
Here
Is he in person ready?
Ay
Well
Shall lessen this big look.
Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train
This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd
Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book
Outworths a noble's blood.
What
Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only
Which your disease requires.
I read in's looks
Matter against me; and his eye reviled
Me
He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;
I'll follow and outstare him.
Stay
What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
Requires slow pace at first: anger is like
A full-hot horse
Can advise me like you: be to yourself
As you would to your friend.
I'll to the king;
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim
There's difference in no persons.
Be advised;
Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
That it do singe yourself: we may outrun
I say again
More stronger to direct you than yourself
Sir
By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow
From sincere motions
We see each grain of gravel
To be corrupt and treasonous.
Say not 'treasonous.'
To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong
As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox
As he is subtle
As able to perform't; his mind and place
Infecting one another
Only to show his pomp as well in France
As here at home
To this last costly treaty
Did break i' the rinsing.
Faith
Pray
The articles o' the combination drew
As himself pleased; and they were ratified
As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end
As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal
Has done this
Which
To the old dam
For 'twas indeed his colour
To whisper Wolsey
His fears were
England and France might
Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily
Deals with our cardinal; and
Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor
Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted
Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
I am sorry
To hear this of him; and could wish he were
Something mistaken in't.
No
I  do pronounce him in that very shape
He shall appear in proof.
Enter BRANDON
Your office
Sir
Of Hereford
Arrest thee of high treason
Of our most sovereign king.
Lo
Under device and practise.
I am sorry
To see you ta'en from liberty
The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure
You shall to the Tower.
It will help me nothing
To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven
Be done in this and all things! I obey.
O my Lord Abergavenny
Nay
To ABERGAVENNY
Is pleased you shall to the Tower
How he determines further.
As the duke said
By me obey'd!
Here is a warrant from
The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies
Of the duke's confessor
So
These are the limbs o' the plot: no more
A monk o' the Chartreux.
O
He.
My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal
Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same. The council-chamber.
Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII
My life itself
Of a full-charged confederacy
To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us
That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person
I'll hear him his confessions justify;
And point by point the treasons of his master
He shall again relate.
A noise within
Nay
Arise
Never name to us; you have half our power:
The other moiety
Repeat your will and take it.
Thank your majesty.
That you would love yourself
Not unconsider'd leave your honour
The dignity of your office
Of my petition.
Lady mine
I am solicited
Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
Sent down among 'em
Of all their loyalties: wherein
Most bitterly on you
Of these exactions
Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he
escapes not
Language unmannerly
The sides of loyalty
In loud rebellion.
Not almost appears
The many to them longing
The spinsters
And lack of other means
Daring the event to the teeth
Taxation!
Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal
Please you
Pertains to the state; and front but in that file
Where others tell steps with me.
No
Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome
To those which would not know them
Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions
Most pestilent to the bearing; and
They are devised by you; or else you suffer
Too hard an exclamation.
Still exaction!
The nature of it? in what kind
I am much too venturous
In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd
Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief
Comes through commissions
The sixth part of his substance
Without delay; and the pretence for this
Is named
Tongues spit their duties out
Allegiance in them; their curses now
Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass
To each incensed will. I would your highness
Would give it quick consideration
There is no primer business.
By my life
And for me
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
By learned approbation of the judges. If I am
Traduced by ignorant tongues
My faculties nor person
The chronicles of my doing
'Tis but the fate of place
That virtue must go through. We must not stint
Our necessary actions
To cope malicious censurers; which ever
That is new-trimm'd
Than vainly longing. What we oft do best
Not ours
For our best act. If we shall stand still
State-statues only.
Things done well
Things done without example
Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent
Of this commission? I believe
We must not rend our subjects from our laws
A trembling contribution! Why
From every tree lop
And
Where this is question'd send our letters
Free pardon to each man that has denied
The force of this commission: pray
I put it to your care.
A word with you.
To the Secretary
Let there be letters writ to every shire
Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised
That through our intercession this revokement
And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you
Further in the proceeding.
Exit Secretary
Enter Surveyor
I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
Is run in your displeasure.
It grieves many:
The gentleman is learn'd
To nature none more bound; his training such
Not well disposed
Than ever they were fair. This man so complete
His hour of speech a minute; he
That once were his
As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--
This was his gentleman in trust--of him
Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
The fore-recited practises; whereof
We cannot feel too little
Stand forth
Out of the Duke of Buckingham.
Speak freely.
First
It would infect his speech
Should without issue die
To make the sceptre his: these very words
I've heard him utter to his son-in-law
Revenge upon the cardinal.
Please your highness
This dangerous conception in this point.
Not friended by by his wish
His will is most malignant; and it stretches
Beyond you
My learn'd lord cardinal
Speak on:
How grounded he his title to the crown
At any time speak aught?
He was brought to this
By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.
What was that Hopkins?
Sir
With words of sovereignty.
How know'st thou this?
Not long before your highness sped to France
Saint Lawrence Poultney
What was the speech among the Londoners
Concerning the French journey: I replied
Said
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft
John de la Car
To hear from him a matter of some moment:
Whom after under the confession's seal
He solemnly had sworn
My chaplain to no creature living
To me
This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs
To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke
Shall govern England.'
If I know you well
On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed
You charge not in your spleen a noble person
And spoil your nobler soul: I say
Yes
Let him on.
Go forward.
On my soul
I told my lord the duke
The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him
To ruminate on this so far
It forged him some design
Should have gone off.
Ha! what
There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?
I can
Proceed.
Being at Greenwich
About Sir William Blomer
I remember
Of such a time: being my sworn servant
'If
The part my father meant to act upon
The usurper Richard; who
Have put his knife to him.'
A giant traitor!
Now
God mend all!
There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?
After 'the duke his father
He stretch'd him
He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor
Was
His father by as much as a performance
Does an irresolute purpose.
There's his period
Call him to present trial: if he may
Find mercy in the law

To think an English courtier may be wise
They must either
Of fool and feather that they got in France
Pertaining thereunto
The faith they have in tennis
Or pack to their old playfellows: there
The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.
'Tis time to give 'em physic
Are grown so catching.
What a loss our ladies
Will have of these trim vanities!
Ay
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going

And have an hour of hearing; and

That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed
His dews fall every where.
No doubt he's noble;
He had a black mouth that said other of him.
He may
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:
Men of his way should be most liberal;
They are set here for examples.

By all your good leaves
My royal choice.
Ye have found him
Unmasking
You hold a fair assembly; you do well
You are a churchman
I am glad
Your grace is grown so pleasant.
My lord chamberlain
An't please your grace
The Viscount Rochford
By heaven
Let it go round.
Sir Thomas Lovell
I' the privy chamber?
Yes
Your grace
I fear
There's fresher air
Lead in your ladies
Good my lord cardinal
To drink to these fair ladies
To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream
Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.
Exeunt with trumpets
ACT II
SCENE I. Westminster. A street.
Enter two Gentlemen
Whither away so fast?
O
Even to the hall
Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
I'll save you
That labour
Of bringing back the prisoner.
Were you there?
Yes
Pray
You may guess quickly what.
Is he found guilty?
Yes
I am sorry for't.
So are a number more.
But
I'll tell you in a little. The great duke
Came to the bar; where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
The king's attorney on the contrary
Urged on the examinations
Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired
To have brought viva voce to his face:
At which appear'd against him his surveyor;
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car
That was he
That fed him with his prophecies?
The same.
All these accused him strongly; which he fain
Would have flung from him
And so his peers
He spoke
Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
After all this
When he was brought again to the bar
His knell rung out
With such an agony
But he fell to himself again
In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.
I do not think he fears death.
Sure
He never was so womanish; the cause
He may a little grieve at.
Certainly
The cardinal is the end of this.
'Tis likely
That trick of state
Was a deep envious one.
At his return
No doubt he will requite it. This is noted
All the commons
Hate him perniciously
They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham
Stay there
Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves  before him; the axe with the edge towards him;  halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL
Let's stand close
All good people
I have this day received a traitor's judgment
The law I bear no malice for my death;
'T has done
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
Be what they will
Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief
For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
For further life in this world I ne'er hope
More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me
Is only bitter to him
And
I do beseech your grace
Were hid against me
Sir Thomas Lovell
As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;
There cannot be those numberless offences
'Gainst me
no black envy
Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;
And if he speak of Buckingham
You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers
Yet are the king's; and
Longer than I have time to tell his years!
Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!
And when old time shall lead him to his end
To the water side I must conduct your grace;
Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux
Prepare there
And fit it with such furniture as suits
The greatness of his person.
Nay
When I came hither
And Duke of Buckingham; now
Yet I am richer than my base accusers
And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.
My noble father
Henry the Seventh succeeding
My father's loss
That made me happy at one stroke has taken
For ever from the world. I had my trial
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
Fell by our servants
A most unnatural and faithless service!
Heaven has an end in all: yet
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
And give your hearts to
The least rub in your fortunes
Like water from ye
But where they mean to sink ye. All good people
Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:
And when you would say something that is sad
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train
O
That were the authors.
If the duke be guiltless
Of an ensuing evil
Good angels keep it from us!
What may it be? You do not doubt my faith
This secret is so weighty
A strong faith to conceal it.
Let me have it;
I do not talk much.
I am confident
A buzzing of a separation
Between the king and Katharine?
Yes
For when the king once heard it
He sent command to the lord mayor straight
To stop the rumor
That durst disperse it.
But that slander
Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain
The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal
To the good queen
That will undo her: to confirm this too
As all think
'Tis the cardinal;
And merely to revenge him on the emperor
For not bestowing on him
I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel
That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal
Will have his will
'Tis woful.
We are too open here to argue this;
Let's think in private more.
Exeunt
SCENE II. An ante-chamber in the palace.
Enter Chamberlain
'My lord

furnished. They were young and handsome

subject
mouths
I fear he will indeed: well
He will have all
Enter
Well met
Good day to both your graces.
How is the king employ'd?
I left him private
What's the cause?
It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
Has crept too near his conscience.
No
Has crept too near another lady.
'Tis so:
This is the cardinal's doing
That blind priest
Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.
How holily he works in all his business!
And with what zeal! for
Between us and the emperor
Dangers
And out of all these to restore the king
That
About his neck
Of her that loves him with that excellence
That angels love good men with; even of her
That
Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true
These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em
Look into these affairs see this main end
The king's eyes
This bold bad man.
And free us from his slavery.
We had need pray
Or this imperious man will work us all
From princes into pages: all men's honours
Lie like one lump before him
Into what pitch he please.
For me
As I am made without him
Touch me alike
I knew him
To him that made him proud
Let's in;
And with some other business put the king
From these sad thoughts
My lord
Excuse me;
The king has sent me otherwhere: besides
Health to your lordships.
Thanks
Exit Chamberlain; and KING HENRY VIII draws the curtain
How sad he looks! sure
Who's there
Pray God he be not angry.
Who's there
Into my private meditations?
Who am I? ha?
A gracious king that pardons all offences
Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way
Is business of estate; in which we come
To know your royal pleasure.
Ye are too bold:
Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:
Is this an hour for temporal affairs
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
Who's there? my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey
Thou art a cure fit for a king.
To CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
You're welcome
Use us and it.
To CARDINAL WOLSEY
My good lord
I be not found a talker.
Sir
I would your grace would give us but an hour
Of private conference.
[To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]
We are busy; go.
[Aside to SUFFOLK]
This priest has no pride in him?
[Aside to NORFOLK]             Not to speak of:
I would not be so sick though for his place:
But this cannot continue.
[Aside to SUFFOLK]      If it do
[Aside to NORFOLK]          I another.
Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK
Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom
Above all princes
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:
Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?
The Spaniard
Have their free voices: Rome
One general tongue unto us
Whom once more I present unto your highness.
And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome
They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.
Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves
I tender my commission; by whose virtue
Cardinal of York
In the unpartial judging of this business.
Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted
Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?
I know your majesty has always loved her
So dear in heart
A woman of less place might ask by law:
Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.
Ay
To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal
I find him a fit fellow.
Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY
Re-enter CARDINAL WOLSEY
[Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand much joy and
favour to you;
You are the king's now.
[Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY]
But to be commanded
For ever by your grace
Come hither
Walks and whispers
My Lord of York
In this man's place before him?
Yes
Was he not held a learned man?
Yes
Believe me
Even of yourself
How! of me?
They will not stick to say you envied him
Heaven's peace be with him!
That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers
There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow
I will have none so near else. Learn this
Deliver this with modesty to the queen.
Exit GARDINER
The most convenient place that I can think of
For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;
There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
My Wolsey
So sweet a bedfellow? But
O
Exeunt
SCENE III. An ante-chamber of the QUEEN'S apartments.
Enter ANNE and an Old Lady
Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:
His highness having lived so long with her
So good a lady that no tongue could ever
Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life
So many courses of the sun enthroned
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
'Tis sweet at first to acquire
Would move a monster.
Hearts of most hard temper
Melt and lament for her.
O
She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal
It from the bearer
As soul and body's severing.
Alas
She's a stranger now again.
So much the more
Must pity drop upon her. Verily
Our content
Is our best having.
By my troth and maidenhead
Beshrew me
You
Affected eminence
Which
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
Nay
Yes
No
"Old Lady:	'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me"
To bear that load of title?
No
Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;
I would not be a young count in your way
Cannot vouchsafe this burthen
Ever to get a boy.
How you do talk!
I swear again
For all the world.
In faith
You'ld venture an emballing: I myself
Would for Carnarvonshire
No more to the crown but that. Lo
Enter Chamberlain
Good morrow
The secret of your conference?
My good lord
Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.
It was a gentle business
The action of good women: there is hope
All will be well.
Now
You bear a gentle mind
Follow such creatures. That you may
Ta'en of your many virtues
Commends his good opinion of you
Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title
A thousand pound a year
I do not know
What kind of my obedience I should tender;
More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
Are not words duly hallow'd
More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes
Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship
Whose health and royalty I pray for.
Lady
The king hath of you.
Aside
I have perused her well;
Beauty and honour in her are so mingled
That they have caught the king: and who knows yet
But from this lady may proceed a gem
To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king
Exit Chamberlain
My honour'd lord.
Why
I have been begging sixteen years in court
Come pat betwixt too early and too late
For any suit of pounds; and you
A very fresh-fish here--fie
This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up
Before you open it.
This is strange to me.
How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence
There was a lady once
Come
With your theme
O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!
No other obligation! By my life
Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time
I know your back will bear a duchess: say
Good lady
The queen is comfortless
In our long absence: pray
What here you've heard to her.
What do you think me?
Exeunt
SCENE IV. A hall in Black-Friars.
Trumpets
Whilst our commission from Rome is read
What's the need?
It hath already publicly been read
You may
Be't so. Proceed.
Say
Henry King of England
Here.
Say
Katharine Queen of England
QUEEN KATHARINE makes no answer
Sir
And to bestow your pity on me: for
I am a most poor woman
No judge indifferent
Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas
Hath my behavior given to your displeasure
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike
As I saw it inclined: when was the hour
I ever contradicted your desire
Have I not strove to love
He were mine enemy? what friend of mine
That had to him derived your anger
Continue in my liking? nay
He was from thence discharged. Sir
That I have been your wife
With many children by you: if
And process of this time
Shut door upon me
To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir
A prince most prudent
And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand
The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
A year before: it is not to be question'd
That they had gather'd a wise council to them
Of every realm
Beseech you
Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel
I will implore: if not
You have here
Of singular integrity and learning
To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless
That longer you desire the court; as well
For your own quiet
What is unsettled in the king.
His grace
Hath spoken well and justly: therefore
And that
Be now produced and heard.
Lord cardinal
Your pleasure
Sir
We are a queen
The daughter of a king
I'll turn to sparks of fire.
Be patient yet.
I will
You are mine enemy
You shall not be my judge: for it is you
Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;
Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again
Refuse you for my judge; whom
At all a friend to truth.
I do profess
You speak not like yourself; who ever yet
Have stood to charity
Of disposition gentle
O'ertopping woman's power. Madam
I have no spleen against you; nor injustice
For you or any: how far I have proceeded
By a commission from the consistory
That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:
The king is present: if it be known to him
That I gainsay my deed
As you have done my truth. If he know
That I am free of your report
I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
It lies to cure me: and the cure is
Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
His highness shall speak in
You
And to say so no more.
My lord
To oppose your cunning. You're meek and
humble-mouth'd;
You sign your place and calling
Is cramm'd with arrogancy
You have
Where powers are your retainers
Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you
Your high profession spiritual: that again
I do refuse you for my judge; and here
She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII
The queen is obstinate
Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
She's going away.
Call her again.
Katharine Queen of England
Madam
What need you note it? pray you
When you are call'd
I will not tarry; no
Upon this business my appearance make
In any of their courts.
Exeunt QUEEN KATHARINE and her Attendants
Go thy ways
That man i' the world who shall report he has
A better wife
Sovereign and pious else
And
Carried herself towards me.
Most gracious sir
Of all these ears
At once and fully satisfied
Did broach this business to your highness; or
Laid any scruple in your way
Induce you to the question on't? or ever
Have to you
A royal lady
Be to the prejudice of her present state
My lord cardinal
That you have many enemies
Why they are so
The queen is put in anger. You're excused:
But will you be more justified? You ever
Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired
It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd
Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:
My conscience first received a tenderness
By the Bishop of Bayonne
Who had been hither sent on the debating
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business
Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
Whether our daughter were legitimate
The bosom of my conscience
The region of my breast; which forced such way
And press'd in with this caution. First
I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had
Commanded nature
Do no more offices of life to't than
The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
Or died where they were made
This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought
Be gladded in't by me: then follows
I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
The wild sea of my conscience
Toward this remedy
Now present here together: that's to say
I then did feel full sick
By all the reverend fathers of the land
And doctors learn'd: first I began in private
With you
How under my oppression I did reek
Very well
I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say
How far you satisfied me.
So please your highness
And consequence of dread
The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;
And did entreat your highness to this course
Which you are running here.
I then moved you
To make this present summons: unsolicited
I left no reverend person in this court;
But by particular consent proceeded
Under your hands and seals: therefore
For no dislike i' the world against the person
Of the good queen
Of my alleged reasons
Prove but our marriage lawful
And kingly dignity
To wear our mortal state to come with her
That's paragon'd o' the world.
So please your highness
That we adjourn this court till further day:
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
Made to the queen
She intends unto his holiness.
"[Aside]	I may perceive"
These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
My learn'd and well-beloved servant
I say
Exeunt in manner as they entered

SCENE I. London. QUEEN KATHARINE's apartments.
Enter QUEEN KATHARINE and her Women
Take thy lute
Sing
SONG
Orpheus with his lute made trees
To his music plants and flowers
Ever sprung; as sun and showers
There had made a lasting spring.
Every thing that heard him play
In sweet music is such art
Fall asleep
Enter a Gentleman
How now!
An't please your grace
Wait in the presence.
Would they speak with me?
They will'd me say so
Pray their graces
To come near.
Exit Gentleman
What can be their business
With me
I do not like their coming. Now I think on't
But all hoods make not monks.
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
Peace to your highness!
Your graces find me here part of a housewife
What are your pleasures with me
May it please you noble madam
Into your private chamber
The full cause of our coming.
Speak it here:
There's nothing I have done yet
Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
My lords
Above a number
Were tried by every tongue
Seek me out
Tanta est erga te mentis integritas
serenissima
O
I am not such a truant since my coming
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange
Pray
Believe me
May be absolved in English.
Noble lady
We come not by the way of accusation
How you stand minded in the weighty difference
Between the king and you; and to deliver
And comforts to your cause.
Most honour'd madam
Both of his truth and him
"[Aside]	To betray me.--"
My lords
Ye speak like honest men; pray God
But how to make ye suddenly an answer
More near my life
Among my maids: full little
Either for such men or such business.
For her sake that I have been
The last fit of my greatness
Alas
Madam
Your hopes and friends are infinite.
In England
But little for my profit: can you think
Or be a known friend
They are
In mine own country
I would your grace
Would leave your griefs
How
Put your main cause into the king's protection;
He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much
Both for your honour better and your cause;
For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye
He tells you rightly.
Ye tell me what ye wish for both
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!
Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
That no king can corrupt.
Your rage mistakes us.
The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:
Mend 'em
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady
I will not wish ye half my miseries;
I have more charity: but say
Take heed
The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.
Madam
You turn the good we offer into envy.
Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye
And all such false professors! would you have me--
If you have any justice
If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
Alas
Is only my obedience. What can happen
To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
Make me a curse like this.
Your fears are worse.
Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself
A woman
Have I with all my full affections
Still met the king? loved him next heaven?
obey'd him?
Been
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well
Bring me a constant woman to her husband
And to that woman
Madam
My lord
Your master wed me to: nothing but death
Shall e'er divorce my dignities.
Pray
Would I had never trod this English earth
Ye have angels' faces
What will become of me now
I am the most unhappy woman living.
Alas
Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom
Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily
If your grace
Could but be brought to know our ends are honest
We are to cure such sorrows
For goodness' sake
How you may hurt yourself
Grow from the king's acquaintance
The hearts of princes kiss obedience
They swell
I know you have a gentle
Those we profess
Madam
With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit
Such doubts
Beware you lose it not: for us
To trust us in your business
To use our utmost  studies in your service.
Do what ye will
You know I am a woman
To make a seemly answer to such persons.
Pray
He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
While I shall have my life. Come
Exeunt
SCENE II. Ante-chamber to KING HENRY VIII's apartment.
Enter NORFOLK
If you will now unite in your complaints
Cannot stand under them: if you omit
The offer of this time
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces
I am joyful
To meet the least occasion that may give me
Remembrance of my father-in-law
Which of the peers
Have uncontemn'd gone by him
Strangely neglected? when did he regard
The stamp of nobleness in any person
Out of himself?
My lords
What he deserves of you and me I know;
What we can do to him
Gives way to us
Bar his access to the king
Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft
Over the king in's tongue.
O
His spell in that is out: the king hath found
Matter against him that for ever mars
The honey of his language. No
Sir
Once every hour.
Believe it
In the divorce his contrary proceedings
Are all unfolded wherein he appears
As I would wish mine enemy.
How came
His practises to light?
Most strangely.
O
The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried
To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if
It did take place
My king is tangled in affection to
A creature of the queen's
Has the king this?
Believe it.
Will this work?
The king in this perceives him
And hedges his own way. But in this point
All his tricks founder
After his patient's death: the king already
Hath married the fair lady.
Would he had!
May you be happy in your wish
For
Now
Trace the conjunction!
My amen to't!
All men's!
There's order given for her coronation:
Marry
To some ears unrecounted. But
In mind and feature: I persuade me
Will fall some blessing to this land
In it be memorised.
But
Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
The Lord forbid!
Marry
No
There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;
Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and
Is posted
The king cried Ha! at this.
Now
But
He is return'd in his opinions; which
Have satisfied the king for his divorce
Almost in Christendom: shortly
Her coronation. Katharine no more
Shall be call'd queen
And widow to Prince Arthur.
This same Cranmer's
A worthy fellow
In the king's business.
He has; and we shall see him
For it an archbishop.
So I hear.
'Tis so.
The cardinal!
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL
Observe
The packet
Gave't you the king?
To his own hand
Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?
Presently
He did unseal them: and the first he view'd
Was in his countenance. You he bade
Attend him here this morning.
Is he ready
To come abroad?
I think
Leave me awhile.
Exit CROMWELL
Aside
It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon
Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:
There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!
No
To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
He's discontented.
May be
Does whet his anger to him.
Sharp enough
[Aside]  The late queen's gentlewoman
This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;
Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
And well deserving? yet I know her for
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
Our cause
Our hard-ruled king. Again
An heretic
Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king
He is vex'd at something.
I would 'twere something that would fret the string
Enter KING HENRY VIII
The king
What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
To his own portion! and what expense by the hour
Seems to flow from him! How
My lord
Stood here observing him: some strange commotion
Is in his brain: he bites his lip
Stops on a sudden
Springs out into fast gait; then stops again
His eye against the moon: in most strange postures
We have seen him set himself.
It may well be;
There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning
Papers of state he sent me to peruse
There
Forsooth
The several parcels of his plate
I find at such proud rate
Possession of a subject.
It's heaven's will:
Some spirit put this paper in the packet
If we did think
His contemplation were above the earth
Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
His thinkings are below the moon
His serious considering.
King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL
Heaven forgive me!
Ever God bless your highness!
Good my lord
Of your best graces in your mind; the which
You were now running o'er: you have scarce time
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
To keep your earthly audit: sure
I deem you an ill husband
To have you therein my companion.
Sir
To think upon the part of business which
I bear i' the state; and nature does require
Her times of preservation
I
You have said well.
And ever may your highness yoke together
With my well saying!
'Tis well said again;
And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:
And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:
His said he did; and with his deed did crown
His word upon you. Since I had my office
Employ'd you where high profits might come home
My bounties upon you.
[Aside]             What should this mean?
[Aside]  The Lord increase this business!
Have I not made you
And
My sovereign
My studied purposes requite; which went
Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours
Have ever come too short of my desires
Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
To the good of your most sacred person and
The profit of the state. For your great graces
Heap'd upon me
Can nothing render but allegiant thanks
Fairly answer'd;
A loyal and obedient subject is
Therein illustrated: the honour of it
Does pay the act of it; as
That
On you than any; so your hand and heart
To me
I do profess
That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
More than mine own; that am
Though all the world should crack their duty to you
Abound
Appear in forms more horrid
'Tis nobly spoken:
Take notice
Giving him papers
And after
What appetite you have.
Exit KING HENRY VIII
What should this mean?
What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
He parted frowning from me
Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion
Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;
Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
I fear
This paper has undone me: 'tis the account
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
For mine own ends; indeed
Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
Made me put this main secret in the packet
I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
No new device to beat this from his brains?
I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
A way
Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'
The letter
I writ to's holiness. Nay then
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;
And
Like a bright exhalation m the evening
Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY
Hear the king's pleasure
To render up the great seal presently
Into our hands; and to confine yourself
To Asher House
Stay:
Where's your commission
Authority so weighty.
Who dare cross 'em
Till I find more than will or words to do it
Of what coarse metal ye are moulded
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
Follow your envious courses
You have Christian warrant for 'em
Bade me enjoy it
The king
It must be himself
Thou art a proud traitor
Proud lord
Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
Have burnt that tongue than said so.
Thy ambition
Of noble Buckingham
The heads of all thy brother cardinals
You sent me deputy for Ireland;
Far from his succor
That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;
Whilst your great goodness
This
This talking lord can lay upon my credit
Found his deserts: how innocent I was
From any private malice in his end
If I loved many words
You have as little honesty as honour
Toward the king
By my soul
shouldst feel
My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords
And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely
All goodness
Is poison to thy stomach.
Yes
Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one
The goodness of your intercepted packets
You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness
My Lord of Norfolk
Of our despised nobility
Collected from his life. I'll startle you
Worse than the scaring bell
Lay kissing in your arms
How much
Those articles
But
So much fairer
And spotless shall mine innocence arise
This cannot save you:
I thank my memory
Some of these articles; and out they shall.
Now
Speak on
I dare your worst objections: if I blush
I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
First
You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.
Then
To foreign princes
Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king
To be your servant.
Then that
Either of king or council
Ambassador to the emperor
To carry into Flanders the great seal.
Item
To Gregory de Cassado
That
Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.
Then that you have sent innumerable substance--
By what means got
To furnish Rome
You have for dignities; to the mere undoing
Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;
Which
O my lord
His faults lie open to the laws; let them
So little of his great self.
I forgive him.
Lord cardinal
To forfeit all your goods
Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.
And so we'll leave you to your meditations
How to live better. For your stubborn answer
About the giving back the great seal to us
So fare you well
Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY
So farewell to the little good you bear me.
Farewell! a long farewell
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms
The third day comes a frost
His greatness is a-ripening
At length broke under me and now has left me
Of a rude stream
Vain pomp and glory of this world
I feel my heart new open'd. O
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
There is
And when he falls
Enter CROMWELL
Why
I have no power to speak
What
At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder
A great man should decline? Nay
How does your grace?
Why
Never so truly happy
I know myself now; and I feel within me
A peace above all earthly dignities
A load would sink a navy
O
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!
I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.
I hope I have: I am able now
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
What news abroad?
The heaviest and the worst
Is your displeasure with the king.
God bless him!
The next is
Lord chancellor in your place.
That's somewhat sudden:
But he's a learned man. May he continue
Long in his highness' favour
For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones
That Cranmer is return'd with welcome
That's news indeed.
Last
Only about her coronation.
There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell
In that one woman I have lost for ever:
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
Upon my smiles. Go
I am a poor fall'n man
To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
That sun
What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
Some little memory of me will stir him--
I know his noble nature--not to let
Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell
For thine own future safety.
O my lord
So good
Bear witness
The king shall have my service: but my prayers
For ever and for ever shall be yours.
Cromwell
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me
Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me
And
Of me more must be heard of
A sure and safe one
Mark but my fall
Cromwell
By that sin fell the angels; how can man
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
Corruption wins not more than honesty.
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's
And
There take an inventory of all I have
I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell
Had I but served my God with half the zeal
I served my king
Have left me naked to mine enemies.
Good sir
So I have. Farewell
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. A street in Westminster.
Enter two Gentlemen
You're well met once again.
So are you.
You come to take your stand here
The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?
'Tis all my business. At our last encounter
'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;
This
'Tis well: the citizens
As
In celebration of this day with shows
Never greater
May I be bold to ask at what that contains
Yes; 'tis the list
Of those that claim their offices this day
By custom of the coronation.
The Duke of Suffolk is the first
To be high-steward; next
I thank you
But
That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
Of Canterbury
Learned and reverend fathers of his order
From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which
She was often cited by them
And
The king's late scruple
Of all these learned men she was divorced
Since which she was removed to Kimbolton
Alas
Trumpets
The trumpets sound: stand close
Hautboys
THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION
1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.
2. Then
3. Lord Chancellor
before him.
4. Choristers
Music
5. Mayor of London
Garter
head a gilt copper crown.
6. Marquess Dorset
him
the dove
Collars of SS.
7. SUFFOLK
on his head
high-steward. With him
rod of marshalship
Collars of SS.
8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;
under it
richly adorned with pearl
side her
Winchester.
9. The old Duchess of Norfolk
gold
ANNE's train.
10. Certain Ladies or Countesses
circlets of gold without flowers.
They pass over the stage in order and state
A royal train
Who's that that bears the sceptre?
Marquess Dorset:
And that the Earl of Surrey
A bold brave gentleman. That should be
The Duke of Suffolk?
'Tis the same: high-steward.
And that my Lord of Norfolk?
Yes;
Heaven bless thee!
Looking on QUEEN ANNE
Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
Sir
Our king has all the Indies in his arms
I cannot blame his conscience.
They that bear
The cloth of honour over her
Of the Cinque-ports.
Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.
I take it
Is that old noble lady
It is; and all the rest are countesses.
Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;
And sometimes falling ones.
No more of that.
Exit procession
Enter a third Gentleman
God save you
Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger
Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled
With the mere rankness of their joy.
You saw
The ceremony?
That I did.
How was it?
Well worth the seeing.
Good sir
As well as I am able. The rich stream
Of lords and ladies
To a prepared place in the choir
A distance from her; while her grace sat down
To rest awhile
The beauty of her person to the people.
Believe me
That ever lay by man: which when the people
Had the full view of
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
Doublets
Been loose
I never saw before. Great-bellied women
In the old time of war
Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven
So strangely in one piece.
But
At length her grace rose
Came to the altar; where she kneel'd
Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.
Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
She had all the royal makings of a queen;
As holy oil
Laid nobly on her: which perform'd
To York-place
Sir
For
'Tis now the king's
I know it;
But 'tis so lately alter'd
Is fresh about me.
What two reverend bishops
Were those that went on each side of the queen?
Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester
He of Winchester
Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's
All the land knows that:
However
Who may that be
Thomas Cromwell;
A man in much esteem with the king
A worthy friend. The king has made him master
O' the jewel house
He will deserve more.
Yes
Come
Is to the court
Something I can command. As I walk thither
You may command us
Exeunt
SCENE II. Kimbolton.
Enter KATHARINE
How does your grace?
O Griffith
My legs
So; now
Didst thou not tell me
Yes
Prithee
If well
For my example.
Well
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York
He could not sit his mule.
Alas
At last
To whom he gave these words
Give him a little earth for charity!'
So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
Pursued him still: and
Foretold should be his last
So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
Yet thus far
Of an unbounded stomach
Himself with princes; one that
His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
He would say untruths; and be ever double
Both in his words and meaning: he was never
His promises were
But his performance
Of his own body he was ill
The clergy in example.
Noble madam
We write in water. May it please your highness
To hear me speak his good now?
Yes
I were malicious else.
This cardinal
Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.
He was a scholar
Exceeding wise
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
And though he were unsatisfied in getting
Those twins Of learning that he raised in you
The other
His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
For then
And
Than man could give him
After my death I wish no other herald
Whom I most hated living
Patience
I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith
I named my knell
On that celestial harmony I go to.
Sad and solemn music
She is asleep: good wench
The vision. Enter
Spirits of peace
Madam
It is not you I call for:
Saw ye none enter since I slept?
None
No? Saw you not
Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces
Cast thousand beams upon me
They promised me eternal happiness;
And brought me garlands
I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall
I am most joyful
Possess your fancy.
Bid the music leave
Music ceases
Do you note
How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?
How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks
She is going
Heaven comfort her!
Enter a Messenger
An't like your grace
You are a saucy fellow:
Deserve we no more reverence?
You are to blame
I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;
My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying
A gentleman
Admit him entrance
Let me ne'er see again.
Exeunt GRIFFITH and Messenger
Re-enter GRIFFITH
If my sight fail not
Madam
O
With me since first you knew me. But
Noble lady
Who grieves much for your weakness
Sends you his princely commendations
O my good lord
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
That gentle physic
But now I am past an comforts here
How does his highness?
Madam
So may he ever do! and ever flourish
Banish'd the kingdom! Patience
No
Giving it to KATHARINE
Sir
This to my lord the king.
Most willing
In which I have commended to his goodness
The model of our chaste loves
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--
She is young
To love her for her mother's sake
Is
Upon my wretched women
Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:
Of which there is not one
For virtue and true beauty of the soul
And
The last is
That they may have their wages duly paid 'em
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
And able means
These are the whole contents: and
To do me this last right.
By heaven
I thank you
In all humility unto his highness:
Say his long trouble now is passing
Out of this world; tell him
Call in more women. When I am dead
With maiden flowers
I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me
A queen
I can no more.
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. London. A gallery in the palace.
Enter GARDINER
It's one o'clock
It hath struck.
These should be hours for necessities
With comforting repose
To waste these times. Good hour of night
Whither so late?
Came you from the king
I did
With the Duke of Suffolk.
I must to him too
Not yet
It seems you are in haste: an if there be
No great offence belongs to't
Some touch of your late business: affairs
In them a wilder nature than the business
That seeks dispatch by day.
My lord
And durst commend a secret to your ear
Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour
She'll with the labour end.
The fruit she goes with
I pray for heartily
Good time
Methinks I could
Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
She's a good creature
Deserve our better wishes.
But
Of mine own way; I know you wise
And
Now
The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell
O' the rolls
Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak
One syllable against him?
Yes
To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day
Incensed the lords o' the council
That does infect the land: with which they moved
Have broken with the king; who hath so far
Given ear to our complaint
And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
Our reasons laid before him
To-morrow morning to the council-board
He be convented. He's a rank weed
I hinder you too long: good night
Many good nights
Exeunt GARDINER and Page
Enter KING HENRY VIII and SUFFOLK
Charles
My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.
Sir
But little
Nor shall not
Now
I could not personally deliver to her
What you commanded me
I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
In the great'st humbleness
Most heartily to pray for her.
What say'st thou
To pray for her? what
So said her woman; and that her sufferance made
Almost each pang a death.
Alas
God safely quit her of her burthen
With gentle travail
Your highness with an heir!
'Tis midnight
Prithee
The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;
For I must think of that which company
Would not be friendly to.
I wish your highness
A quiet night; and my good mistress will
Remember in my prayers.
Charles
Exit SUFFOLK
Enter DENNY
Well
Sir
Ha! Canterbury?
Ay
'Tis true: where is he
He attends your highness' pleasure.
Exit DENNY
[Aside]  This is about that which the bishop spake:
I am happily come hither.
Re-enter DENNY
Avoid the gallery.
LOVELL seems to stay
Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!
Exeunt LOVELL and DENNY
[Aside]
I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
How now
Wherefore I sent for you.
[Kneeling]              It is my duty
To attend your highness' pleasure.
Pray you
Come
I have news to tell you: come
Ah
I have
Heard many grievous
This morning come before us; where
Which will require your answer
Your patience to you
To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us
Would come against you.
[Kneeling]
I humbly thank your highness;
And am right glad to catch this good occasion
Most throughly to be winnow'd
And corn shall fly asunder: for
Than I myself
Stand up
Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
In us
Prithee
What manner of man are you? My lord
You would have given me your petition
I should have ta'en some pains to bring together
Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you
Most dread liege
If they shall fail
What can be said against me.
Know you not
How your state stands i' the world
Your enemies are many
Must bear the same proportion; and not ever
The justice and the truth o' the question carries
The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
To swear against you? such things have been done.
You are potently opposed; and with a malice
Of as great size. Ween you of better luck
Upon this naughty earth? Go to
You take a precipice for no leap of danger
God and your majesty
Protect mine innocence
The trap is laid for me!
Be of good cheer;
They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
Keep comfort to you; and this morning see
You do appear before them: if they shall chance
Fail not to use
The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties
Will render you no remedy
Deliver them
There make before them. Look
He's honest
I swear he is true--hearted; and a soul
None better in my kingdom. Get you gone
Exit CRANMER
He has strangled
His language in his tears.
Enter Old Lady
[Within]                 Come back: what mean you?
I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring
Will make my boldness manners. Now
Fly o'er thy royal head
Under their blessed wings!
Now
I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?
Say
Ay
And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven
Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl
Desires your visitation
Acquainted with this stranger 'tis as like you
As cherry is to cherry.
Lovell!
Sir?
Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.
Exit
An hundred marks! By this light
An ordinary groom is for such payment.
I will have more
Said I for this
I will have more
Exeunt
SCENE II. Before the council-chamber. Pursuivants
attending.
Enter CRANMER
I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman
To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!
Who waits there? Sure
Enter Keeper
Yes
But yet I cannot help you.
Why?
Enter DOCTOR BUTTS
Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.
So.
[Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad
I came this way so happily: the king
Shall understand it presently.
Exit
"[Aside]	'Tis Butts"
Pray heaven
God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice--
To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me
Wait else at door
Must be fulfill'd
Enter the KING HENRY VIII and DOCTOR BUTTS at a window above
I'll show your grace the strangest sight--
What's that
I think your highness saw this many a day.
Body o' me
There
The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;
Who holds his state at door
Ha! 'tis he
Is this the honour they do one another?
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
They had parted so much honesty among 'em
At least
A man of his place
By holy Mary
Let 'em alone
We shall hear more anon.
Exeunt
SCENE III. The Council-Chamber.
Enter Chancellor; places himself at the upper end  of the table on the left hand; a seat being left  void above him
Speak to the business
Why are we met in council?
Please your honours
Has he had knowledge of it?
Yes.
Who waits there?
Without
Yes.
My lord archbishop;
And has done half an hour
Let him come in.
Your grace may enter now.
CRANMER enters and approaches the council-table
My good lord archbishop
To sit here at this present
That chair stand empty: but we all are men
Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty
And want of wisdom
The whole realm
Which reformation must be sudden too
Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle
To one man's honour
Commotions
Of the whole state: as
My good lords
Both of my life and office
And the strong course of my authority
Might go one way
Was ever
Pray heaven
With less allegiance in it! Men that make
Envy and crooked malice nourishment
Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships
Nay
My lord
Where
Ah
You are always my good friend; if your will pass
'Tis my undoing: love and meekness
Win straying souls with modesty again
In doing daily wrongs. I could say more
My lord
My Lord of Winchester
For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty
To load a falling man.
Good master secretary
Of all this table
Why
Do not I know you for a favourer
Of this new sect? ye are not sound.
Not sound?
Not sound
Would you were half so honest!
Men's prayers then would seek you
I shall remember this bold language.
Do.
Remember your bold life too.
This is too much;
Forbear
I have done.
And I.
Then thus for you
You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;
There to remain till the king's further pleasure
Be known unto us: are you all agreed
We are.
Is there no other way of mercy
What other
Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.
Let some o' the guard be ready there.
Enter Guard
For me?
Must I go like a traitor thither?
Receive him
Stay
By virtue of that ring
Out of the gripes of cruel men
To a most noble judge
This is the king's ring.
'Tis no counterfeit.
'Tis the right ring
Do you think
Of this man to be vex'd?
'Tis now too certain:
How much more is his life in value with him?
Would I were fairly out on't!
My mind gave me
Against this man
And his disciples only envy at
Enter KING
Dread sovereign
In daily thanks
Not only good and wise
One that
The chief aim of his honour; and
That holy duty
The cause betwixt her and this great offender.
You were ever good at sudden commendations
To hear such flattery now
They are too thin and bare to hide offences.
To me you cannot reach
But
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
To CRANMER
Good man
He
By all that's holy
Than but once think this place becomes thee not.
May it please your grace
No
I had thought I had had men of some understanding
And wisdom of my council; but I find none.
Was it discretion
This honest man
At chamber--door? and one as great as you are?
Why
Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
Power as he was a counsellor to try him
Which ye shall never have while I live.
Thus far
To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed
Concerning his imprisonment
Well
Take him
I will say thus much for him
May be beholding to a subject
Am
Make me no more ado
Be friends
Canterbury
That is
The greatest monarch now alive may glory
In such an honour: how may I deserve it
That am a poor and humble subject to you?
Come
shall have two noble partners with you; the old
Duchess of Norfolk
these please you?
Once more
With a true heart
And brother-love I do it.
And let heaven
Witness
Good man
The common voice
Of thee
A shrewd turn
Come
To have this young one made a Christian.
As I have made ye one
So I grow stronger
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The palace yard.
Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man
You'll leave your noise anon
take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves
Within
Good master porter
Belong to the gallows
this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree
staves
'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing
christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here
Pray
Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--
To scatter 'em
On May-day morning; which will never be:
We may as well push against Powle's
How got they in
Alas
As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--
You see the poor remainder--could distribute
You did nothing
I am not Samson
That had a head to hit
And that I would not for a cow
Within
Do you hear
I shall be with you presently
Keep the door close
What would you have me do?
What should you do
dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have
we some strange Indian with the great tool come to
court
fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian
conscience
thousand; here will be father
The spoons will be the bigger
fellow somewhat near the door
brazier by his face
of the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand
about him are under the line
penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on
the head
against me; he stands there
blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small
wit near him
porringer fell off her head
combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once
might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to
her succor
she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my
place: at length they came to the broom-staff to
me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of
boys behind 'em
of pebbles
'em
These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse
the tribulation of Tower-hill
Limehouse
I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum
are like to dance these three days; besides the
running banquet of two beadles that is to come.
Enter Chamberlain
Mercy o' me
They grow still too; from all parts they are coming
There's a trim rabble let in: are all these
Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have
Great store of room
An't please
your honour
An army cannot rule 'em.
As I live
By the heels
Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;
And here ye lie baiting of bombards
Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
They're come already from the christening:
Go
To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
Make way there for the princess.
You great fellow
You i' the camlet
I'll peck you o'er the pales else.
Exeunt
SCENE V. The palace.
Enter trumpets
Heaven
life
princess of England
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard
[Kneeling] And to your royal grace
All comfort
Thank you
What is her name?
Elizabeth.
Stand up
KING HENRY VIII kisses the child
With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!
Into whose hand I give thy life.
Amen.
My noble gossips
I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady
Let me speak
Let none think flattery
This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
Though in her cradle
Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings
But few now living can behold that goodness--
A pattern to all princes living with her
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces
She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn
In her days every man shall eat in safety
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:
God shall be truly known; and those about her
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour
Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
The bird of wonder dies
So shall she leave her blessedness to one
Shall star-like rise
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine
Shall be
To all the plains about him: our children's children
Shall see this
Thou speakest wonders.
She shall be
Would I had known no more! but she must die
To the ground
O lord archbishop
This happy child
This oracle of comfort has so pleased me
To see what this child does
I thank ye all. To you
I have received much honour by your presence
Ye must all see the queen
Has business at his house; for all shall stay:
This little one shall make it holiday.

EPILOGUE
'Tis ten to one this play can never please
All that are here: some come to take their ease
Abused extremely
Which we have not done neither: that
For this play at this time
The merciful construction of good women;
For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile
All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap
ACT I
SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.
Enter KING JOHN
Now
Thus
In my behavior to the majesty
A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'
Silence
Philip of France
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son
To this fair island and the territories
Which sways usurpingly these several titles
What follows if we disallow of this?
The proud control of fierce and bloody war
Here have we war for war and blood for blood
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth
Bear mine to him
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
For ere thou canst report I will be there
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
And sullen presage of your own decay.
An honourable conduct let him have:
Pembroke
Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE
What now
How that ambitious Constance would not cease
Till she had kindled France and all the world
This might have been prevented and made whole
With very easy arguments of love
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
Our strong possession and our right for us.
Your strong possession much more than your right
So much my conscience whispers in your ear
Enter a Sheriff
My liege
Come from country to be judged by you
Let them approach.
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
This expedition's charge.
Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD
What men are you?
Your faithful subject I
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
What art thou?
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
Is that the elder
You came not of one mother then
Most certain of one mother
That is well known; and
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
Of that I doubt
Out on thee
And wound her honour with this diffidence.
I
That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
The which if he can prove
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
A good blunt fellow. Why
I know not why
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
But whether I be as true begot or no
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
If old sir Robert did beget us both
And were our father and this son like him
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
Why
He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
Do you not read some tokens of my son
In the large composition of this man?
Mine eye hath well examined his parts
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah
Because he hath a half-face
With half that face would he have all my land:
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!
My gracious liege
Well
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
To Germany
To treat of high affairs touching that time.
The advantage of his absence took the king
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak
Between my father and my mother lay
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
His lands to me
That this my mother's son was none of his;
And if he were
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
Then
Sirrah
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
That marry wives. Tell me
In sooth
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
In sooth he might; then
My mother's son did get your father's heir;
Your father's heir must have your father's land.
Shall then my father's will be of no force
To dispossess that child which is not his?
Of no more force to dispossess me
Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
And like thy brother
Madam
And if my legs were two such riding-rods
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Lest men should say 'Look
And
I would not be sir Nob in any case.
I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune
I am a soldier and now bound to France.
Brother
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year
Madam
Nay
Our country manners give our betters way.
What is thy name?
Philip
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:
Kneel thou down Philip
Brother by the mother's side
My father gave me honour
Now blessed by the hour
The very spirit of Plantagenet!
I am thy grandam
Madam
Something about
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night
Near or far off
Go
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
Come
For France
Brother
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
Exeunt all but BASTARD
A foot of honour better than I was;
But many a many foot of land the worse.
Well
'Good den
And if his name be George
For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
'Tis too respective and too sociable
For your conversion. Now your traveller
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir
Thus
And then comes answer like an Absey book:
'O sir
At your employment; at your service
'No
And so
But this is worshipful society
And fits the mounting spirit like myself
That doth not smack of observation;
And so am I
And not alone in habit and device
Sweet
Which
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY
O me! it is my mother. How now
What brings you here to court so hastily?
Where is that slave
My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
Colbrand the giant
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?
Sir Robert's son! Ay
He is sir Robert's son
James Gurney
Good leave
Philip! sparrow: James
Exit GURNEY
Madam
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
Sir Robert could do well: marry
We know his handiwork: therefore
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too
What means this scorn
Knight
What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
But
I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;
Legitimation
Then
Some proper man
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
As faithfully as I deny the devil.
King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:
By long and vehement suit I was seduced
To make room for him in my husband's bed:
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
Thou art the issue of my dear offence
Now
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
The aweless lion could not wage the fight
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
May easily win a woman's. Ay
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
When I was got
Come
And they shall say
Who says it was
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. France. Before Angiers.
Enter AUSTRIA and forces
Before Angiers well met
Arthur
And fought the holy wars in Palestine
And for amends to his posterity
Of thy unnatural uncle
Embrace him
God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
The rather that you give his offspring life
I give you welcome with a powerless hand
Welcome before the gates of Angiers
A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
And coops from other lands her islanders
And confident from foreign purposes
Salute thee for her king: till then
O
To make a more requital to your love!
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
In such a just and charitable war.
Well then
Against the brows of this resisting town.
Call for our chiefest men of discipline
We'll lay before this town our royal bones
Stay for an answer to your embassy
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
Enter CHATILLON
A wonder
What England says
We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
And stir them up against a mightier task.
England
To land his legions all as soon as I;
His marches are expedient to this town
With him along is come the mother-queen
With her her niece
With them a bastard of the king's deceased
In brief
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
Did nearer float upon the swelling tide
Drum beats
The interruption of their churlish drums
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
By how much unexpected
We must awake endavour for defence;
For courage mounteth with occasion:
Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
Enter KING JOHN
Peace be to France
Our just and lineal entrance to our own;
If not
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.
Peace be to England
From France to England
England we love; and for that England's sake
With burden of our armour here we sweat.
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
But thou from loving England art so far
Cut off the sequence of posterity
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;
These eyes
This little abstract doth contain that large
Which died in Geffrey
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born
And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God
How comes it then that thou art call'd a king
From whom hast thou this great commission
From that supernal judge
In any breast of strong authority
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
Alack
Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
Who is it thou dost call usurper
Let me make answer; thy usurping son.
Out
My bed was ever to thy son as true
As thine was to thy husband; and this boy
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
Than thou and John in manners; being as like
As rain to water
My boy a bastard! By my soul
His father never was so true begot:
It cannot be
There's a good mother
There's a good grandam
Peace!
Hear the crier.
What the devil art thou?
One that will play the devil
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes
I'll smoke your skin-coat
Sirrah
O
That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
It lies as sightly on the back of him
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:
But
What craker is this same that deafs our ears
With this abundance of superfluous breath?
Lewis
Women and fools
King John
England and Ireland
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
My life as soon: I do defy thee
Arthur of Bretagne
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:
Submit thee
Come to thy grandam
Do
Give grandam kingdom
Give it a plum
There's a good grandam.
Good my mother
I would that I were low laid in my grave:
I am not worth this coil that's made for me.
His mother shames him so
Now shame upon you
His grandam's wrongs
Ay
To do him justice and revenge on you.
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!
Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp
The dominations
Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;
The canon of the law is laid on him
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.
Bedlam
I have but this to say
On this removed issue
And with her plague; her sin his injury
Thou unadvised scold
A will that bars the title of thy son.
Ay
A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!
Peace
It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
To these ill-tuned repetitions.
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak
Whose title they admit
Trumpet sounds. Enter certain Citizens upon the walls
Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
'Tis France
England
You men of Angiers
You loving men of Angiers
For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
These flags of France
Before the eye and prospect of your town
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
All preparation for a bloody siege
All merciless proceeding by these French
Confronts your city's eyes
And but for our approach those sleeping stones
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
Had been dishabited
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
But on the sight of us your lawful king
Have brought a countercheque before your gates
And now
Which trust accordingly
When I have said
Lo
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
Of him it holds
For this down-trodden equity
In warlike march these greens before your town
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
In the relief of this oppressed child
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
To pay that duty which you truly owe
To that owes it
And then our arms
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire
Which here we came to spout against your town
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer
Can hide you from our messengers of war
Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.
Then tell us
Or shall we give the signal to our rage
And stalk in blood to our possession?
In brief
For him
Acknowledge then the king
That can we not; but he that proves the king
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.
Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
And if not that
Bastards
To verify our title with their lives.
As many and as well-born bloods as those
Some bastards too.
Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
Till you compound whose right is worthiest
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
That to their everlasting residence
Amen
Saint George
Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door
To AUSTRIA
Sirrah
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide
Peace! no more.
O tremble
Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
In best appointment all our regiments.
Speed then
It shall be so; and at the other hill
Command the rest to stand. God and our right!
Exeunt
Here after excursions
You men of Angiers
Much work for tears in many an English mother
Many a widow's husband grovelling lies
And victory
Upon the dancing banners of the French
Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.
Enter English Herald
Rejoice
King John
Their armours
There stuck no plume in any English crest
That is removed by a staff of France;
Our colours do return in those same hands
That did display them when we first march'd forth;
And
Our lusty English
Open your gates and gives the victors way.
Heralds
Of both your armies; whose equality
By our best eyes cannot be censured:
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;
Strength match'd with strength
Both are alike; and both alike we like.
One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even
Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP
France
Say
Whose passage
With course disturb'd even thy confining shores
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
England
Rather
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
Ha
O
The swords of soldiers are his teeth
And now he feasts
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
Cry
Then let confusion of one part confirm
The other's peace: till then
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
Speak
The king of England; when we know the king.
Know him in us
In us
And bear possession of our person here
A greater power then we denies all this;
And till it be undoubted
Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;
King'd of our fears
By heaven
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
Your royal presences be ruled by me:
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
By east and west let France and England mount
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
I'ld play incessantly upon these jades
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
That done
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
Then
Out of one side her happy minion
How like you this wild counsel
Smacks it not something of the policy?
Now
And lay this Angiers even to the ground;
Then after fight who shall be king of it?
An if thou hast the mettle of a king
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground
Make work upon ourselves
Let it be so. Say
We from the west will send destruction
Into this city's bosom.
I from the north.
Our thunder from the south
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
O prudent discipline! From north to south:
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:
I'll stir them to it. Come
Hear us
Win you this city without stroke or wound;
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
Persever not
Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
That daughter there of Spain
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty
If zealous love should go in search of virtue
If love ambitious sought a match of birth
Such as she is
If not complete of
And she again wants nothing
He is the half part of a blessed man
And she a fair divided excellence
O
And two such shores to two such streams made one
This union shall do more than battery can
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match
More free from motion
In moral fury half so peremptory
Here's a stay
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
He speaks plain cannon fire
He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
But buffets better than a fist of France:
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
Son
Give with our niece a dowry large enough:
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
I see a yielding in the looks of France;
Mark
Are capable of this ambition
Of soft petitions
Why answer not the double majesties
This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?
Speak England first
To speak unto this city: what say you?
If that the Dauphin there
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
For Anjou and fair Touraine
In titles
What say'st thou
I do
A wonder
Which being but the shadow of your son
I do protest I never loved myself
Till now infixed I beheld myself
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
Whispers with BLANCH
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
Himself love's traitor: this is pity now
In such a love so vile a lout as he.
My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
If he see aught in you that makes him like
Or if you will
Further I will not flatter you
What say these young ones? What say you my niece?
That she is bound in honour still to do
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
Speak then
Nay
For I do love her most unfeignedly.
Then do I give Volquessen
Philip of France
It likes us well; young princes
And your lips too; for I am well assured
That I did so when I was first assured.
Now
For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
I know she is not
Her presence would have interrupted much:
Where is she and her son? tell me
She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
And
Will give her sadness very little cure.
Brother of England
This widow lady? In her right we came;
Which we
We will heal up all;
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
Some speedy messenger bid her repair
To our solemnity: I trust we shall
That we shall stop her exclamation.
Go we
Exeunt all but the BASTARD
Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
John
As God's own soldier
With that same purpose-changer
But the word 'maid
And this same bias
And why rail I on this Commodity?
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
But for my hand
Well
And say there is no sin but to be rich;
And being rich
To say there is no vice but beggary.
Since kings break faith upon commodity

ACT III
SCENE I. The French King's pavilion.
Enter CONSTANCE
Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
Shall Lewis have Blanch
It is not so; thou hast misspoke
Be well advised
It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:
I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word
Is but the vain breath of a common man:
Believe me
I have a king's oath to the contrary.
Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
Then speak again; not all thy former tale
As true as I believe you think them false
That give you cause to prove my saying true.
O
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die.
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy
France friend with England
Fellow
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
What other harm have I
Which harm within itself so heinous is
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.
I do beseech you
If thou
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
But thou art fair
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John
Tell me
Envenom him with words
And leave those woes alone which I alone
Am bound to under-bear.
Pardon me
Thou mayst
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
To me and to the state of my great grief
Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
That no supporter but the huge firm earth
Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
Here is my throne
Seats herself on the ground
Enter KING JOHN
'Tis true
Ever in France shall be kept festival:
To solemnize this day the glorious sun
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:
The yearly course that brings this day about
Shall never see it but a holiday.
A wicked day
Rising
What hath this day deserved? what hath it done
Among the high tides in the calendar?
Nay
Or
Pray that their burthens may not fall this day
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
No bargains break that are not this day made:
This day
By heaven
To curse the fair proceedings of this day:
Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?
You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
Resembling majesty
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace
Arm
A widow cries; be husband to me
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the day in peace; but
Hear me
Lady Constance
War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war
O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
That bloody spoil: thou slave
Thou little valiant
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave
Upon thy stars
Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame
O
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
Thou darest not say so
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
Hail
To thee
I Pandulph
Why thou against the church
Keep Stephen Langton
Of Canterbury
This
What earthy name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
Thou canst not
So slight
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
But as we
So tell the pope
To him and his usurp'd authority.
Brother of England
Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest
And by the merit of vile gold
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
Against the pope and count his friends my foes.
Then
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
From his allegiance to an heretic;
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd
Thy hateful life.
O
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
Good father cardinal
To my keen curses; for without my wrong
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
There's law and warrant
And for mine too: when law can do no right
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here
Therefore
Philip of France
And raise the power of France upon his head
Look'st thou pale
Look to that
King Philip
And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
Well
Your breeches best may carry them.
Philip
What should he say
Bethink you
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
Forego the easier.
That's the curse of Rome.
O Lewis
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith
O
O then
Keep my need up
The king is moved
O
Do so
Hang nothing but a calf's-skin
I am perplex'd
What canst thou say but will perplex thee more
Good reverend father
This royal hand and mine are newly knit
Married in league
With all religious strength of sacred vows;
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Was deep-sworn faith
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves
To clap this royal bargain up of peace
With slaughter's pencil
The fearful difference of incensed kings:
And shall these hands
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host
Of true sincerity? O
Out of your grace
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
To do your pleasure and continue friends.
All form is formless
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church
France
I may disjoin my hand
So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
And like a civil war set'st oath to oath
First made to heaven
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
And may not be performed by thyself
Is not amiss when it is truly done
The better act of purposes mistook
Is to mistake again; though indirect
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
It is religion that doth make vows kept;
But thou hast sworn against religion
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
To swear
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
And most forsworn
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions:
Upon which better part our prayers come in
The peril of our curses light on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
Rebellion
Will't not be?
Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?
Father
Upon thy wedding-day?
Against the blood that thou hast married?
What
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
O husband
Is husband in my mouth! even for that name
Against mine uncle.
O
Forethought by heaven!
Now shall I see thy love: what motive may
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
That which upholdeth him that thee upholds
I muse your majesty doth seem so cold
I will denounce a curse upon his head.
Thou shalt not need. England
O fair return of banish'd majesty!
O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
France
Old Time the clock-setter
The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day
Which is the side that I must go withal?
I am with both: each army hath a hand;
And in their rage

Assured loss before the match be play'd.

Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will
As dear be to thee as thy father was.
O
[To the BASTARD]  Cousin
haste before:
And
Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels
Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace
Must by the hungry now be fed upon:
Use our commission in his utmost force.
Bell
I leave your highness. Grandam
Farewell
Coz
Exit the BASTARD
Come hither
Come hither
There is a soul counts thee her creditor
And with advantage means to pay thy love:
And my good friend
Lives in this bosom
Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say
By heaven
To say what good respect I have of thee.
I am much bounden to your majesty.
Good friend
I had a thing to say
The sun is in the heaven
To give me audience: if the midnight bell
Did
If this same were a churchyard where we stand
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment
Without a tongue
Then
But
And
So well
Do not I know thou wouldst?
Good Hubert
On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what
And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread
Thou art his keeper.
And I'll keep him so
Death.
My lord?
A grave.
He shall not live.
Enough.
I could be merry now. Hubert
Well
Remember. Madam
I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.
My blessing go with thee!
For England
Hubert shall be your man
With all true duty. On toward Calais
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The same. KING PHILIP'S tent.
Enter KING PHILIP
So
Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.
Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.
What can go well
Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?
And bloody England into England gone
What he hath won
So hot a speed with such advice disposed
Of any kindred action like to this?
Well could I bear that England had this praise
Enter CONSTANCE
Look
Holding the eternal spirit against her will
I prithee
Lo
Patience
No
Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
And ring these fingers with thy household worms
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
And be a carrion monster like thyself:
Come
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love
O fair affliction
No
O
Then with a passion would I shake the world;
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice
Lady
Thou art not holy to belie me so;
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
Young Arthur is my son
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
For then
O
Preach some philosophy to make me mad
For being not mad but sensible of grief
How I may be deliver'd of these woes
If I were mad
I am not mad; too well
The different plague of each calamity.
Bind up those tresses. O
In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen
Do glue themselves in sociable grief
To England
Bind up your hairs.
Yes
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
'O that these hands could so redeem my son
But now I envy at their liberty
And
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
If that be true
For since the birth of Cain
But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
And chase the native beauty from his cheek
And he will look as hollow as a ghost
I shall not know him: therefore never
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
He talks to me that never had a son.
You are as fond of grief as of your child.
Grief fills the room up of my absent child
Then
Fare you well: had you such a loss as I
I will not keep this form upon my head
O Lord! my boy
My life
My widow-comfort
Exit
I fear some outrage
Exit
There's nothing in this world can make me joy:
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.
Before the curing of a strong disease
What have you lost by losing of this day?
All days of glory
If you had won it
No
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
In this which he accounts so clearly won:
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?
As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
For even the breath of what I mean to speak
Shall blow each dust
Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
That
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;
And he that stands upon a slippery place
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
That John may stand
So be it
But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
You
And lose it
How green you are and fresh in this old world!
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal
To cheque his reign
No natural exhalation in the sky
And call them meteors
May be he will not touch young Arthur's life
O
Of all his people shall revolt from him
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
And
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
Is now in England
Were there in arms
To train ten thousand English to their side
What may be wrought out of their discontent
For England go: I will whet on the king.
Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:
If you say ay
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. A room in a castle.
Enter HUBERT and Executioners
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
Within the arras: when I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
Exeunt Executioners
Young lad
Enter ARTHUR
Good morrow
Good morrow
As little prince
To be more prince
Indeed
Mercy on me!
Methinks no body should be sad but I:
Yet
And so I would be here
My uncle practises more harm to me:
He is afraid of me and I of him:
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
No
I were your son
[Aside]  If I talk to him
He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
Are you sick
In sooth
I warrant I love you more than you do me.
[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.
Read here
Showing a paper
Aside
How now
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
I must be brief
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
Too fairly
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
Young boy
And will you?
And I will.
Have you the heart? When your head did but ache
And with my hand at midnight held your head
Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
Many a poor man's son would have lien still
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
But you at your sick service had a prince.
Nay
And call it cunning: do
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill
These eyes that never did nor never shall
So much as frown on you.
I have sworn to do it;
And with hot irons must I burn them out.
Ah
The iron of itself
And quench his fiery indignation
Even in the matter of mine innocence;
Nay
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes
Come forth.
Stamps
Re-enter Executioners
Do as I bid you do.
O
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
Give me the iron
Alas
I will not struggle
For heaven sake
Nay
I will not stir
Thrust but these men away
Go
I am best pleased to be from such a deed.
Exeunt Executioners
Alas
He hath a stern look
Let him come back
Give life to yours.
Come
Is there no remedy?
None
O heaven
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there
Is this your promise? go to
Hubert
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:
Let me not hold my tongue
Or
Though to no use but still to look on you!
Lo
And would not harm me.
I can heat it
No
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;
There is no malice in this burning coal;
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.
But with my breath I can revive it
An if you do
And glow with shame of your proceedings
Nay
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight
All things that you should use to do me wrong
Deny their office: only you do lack
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
Well
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose
O
You were disguised.
Peace; no more. Adieu.
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
And
O heaven! I thank you
Silence; no more: go closely in with me:
Much danger do I undergo for thee.
Exeunt
SCENE II. KING JOHN'S palace.
Enter KING JOHN
Here once again we sit
This 'once again
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
With any long'd-for change or better state.
Therefore
Unto the rainbow
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
But that your royal pleasure must be done
In this the antique and well noted face
Of plain old form is much disfigured;
And
When workmen strive to do better than well
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse
Discredit more in hiding of the fault
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
To this effect
To overbear it
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
Some reasons of this double coronation
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;
And more
What you would have reform'd that is not well
I will both hear and grant you your requests.
Then I
Bend their best studies
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
To break into this dangerous argument
If what in rest you have in right you hold
The steps of wrong
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
The rich advantage of good exercise?
That the time's enemies may not have this
To grace occasions
That you have bid us ask his liberty;
Which for our goods we do no further ask
Than whereupon our weal
Enter HUBERT
Let it be so: I do commit his youth
To your direction. Hubert
Taking him apart
This is the man should do the bloody deed;
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
The image of a wicked heinous fault
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done
The colour of the king doth come and go
Between his purpose and his conscience
His passion is so ripe
And when it breaks
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
Good lords
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.
Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
Indeed we heard how near his death he was
Before the child himself felt he was sick:
This must be answer'd either here or hence.
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
That greatness should so grossly offer it:
So thrive it in your game! and so
Stay yet
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle
This must not be thus borne: this will break out
To all our sorrows
Exeunt Lords
They burn in indignation. I repent:
There is no sure foundation set on blood
Enter a Messenger
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
From France to England. Never such a power
For any foreign preparation
Was levied in the body of a land.
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;
For when you should be told they do prepare
O
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care
My liege
Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died
Your noble mother: and
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
I idly heard; if true or false I know not.
Withhold thy speed
O
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
How wildly then walks my estate in France!
Under whose conduct came those powers of France
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?
Under the Dauphin.
Thou hast made me giddy
With these ill tidings.
Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret
Now
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
My head with more ill news
But if you be afeard to hear the worst
Bear with me cousin
Under the tide: but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood
To any tongue
How I have sped among the clergymen
But as I travell'd hither through the land
Possess'd with rumours
And here a prophet
From forth the streets of Pomfret
With many hundreds treading on his heels;
To whom he sung
Thou idle dreamer
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
Hubert
And on that day at noon whereon he says
I shall yield up my crown
Deliver him to safety; and return
Exeunt HUBERT with PETER
O my gentle cousin
The French
Besides
Of Arthur
On your suggestion.
Gentle kinsman
I have a way to win their loves again;
Bring them before me.
I will seek them out.
Nay
O
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
Be Mercury
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
Exit
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
And be thou he.
With all my heart
Exit
My mother dead!
Re-enter HUBERT
My lord
Four fixed
The other four in wondrous motion.
Five moons!
Old men and beldams in the streets
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
And when they talk of him
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist
I saw a smith stand with his hammer
Who
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:
Another lean unwash'd artificer
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
To wish him dead
No had
It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life
To understand a law
Of dangerous majesty
More upon humour than advised respect.
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
O
Is to be made
Witness against us to damnation!
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect
And thou
My lord--
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
When I spake darkly what I purposed
But thou didst understand me by my signs
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
Yea
The deed
Out of my sight
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved
Nay
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
Arm you against your other enemies
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
Within this bosom never enter'd yet
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
And you have slander'd nature in my form
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
Doth Arthur live? O
Forgive the comment that my passion made
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
O
The angry lords with all expedient haste.
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
Exeunt
SCENE III. Before the castle.
Enter ARTHUR
The wall is high
Good ground
There's few or none do know me: if they did
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.
If I get down
As good to die and go
Leaps down
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:
Heaven take my soul
Dies
Enter PEMBROKE
Lords
It is our safety
This gentle offer of the perilous time.
Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
The Count Melun
Is much more general than these lines import.
To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
Two long days' journey
Enter the BASTARD
Once more to-day well met
The king by me requests your presence straight.
The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
We will not line his thin bestained cloak
With our pure honours
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
Whate'er you think
Our griefs
But there is little reason in your grief;
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
Sir
'Tis true
This is the prison. What is he lies here?
Seeing ARTHUR
O death
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
Murder
Or
Sir Richard
Or do you almost think
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
All murders past do stand excused in this:
And this
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
It is a damned and a bloody work;
The graceless action of a heavy hand
If that it be the work of any hand!
We had a kind of light what would ensue:
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
The practise and the purpose of the king:
From whose obedience I forbid my soul
The incense of a vow
Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
Enter HUBERT
Lords
Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.
O
Avaunt
I am no villain.
Must I rob the law?
Drawing his sword
Your sword is bright
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
Stand back
By heaven
I would not have you
Lest I
Your worth
Out
Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
My innocent life against an emperor.
Thou art a murderer.
Do not prove me so;
Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false
Cut him to pieces.
Keep the peace
Stand by
Thou wert better gall the devil
If thou but frown on me
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron
What wilt thou do
Second a villain and a murderer?
Lord Bigot
Who kill'd this prince?
'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
I honour'd him
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
And he
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
Away with me
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
Away toward Bury
There tell the king he may inquire us out.
Exeunt Lords
Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy
Do but hear me
Ha! I'll tell thee what;
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be
Upon my soul--
If thou didst but consent
To this most cruel act
And if thou want'st a cord
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself
I do suspect thee very grievously.
If I in act
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay
I left him well.
Go
I am amazed
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
How easy dost thou take all England up!
From forth this morsel of dead royalty
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
A thousand businesses are brief in hand
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. KING JOHN'S palace.
Enter KING JOHN
Thus have I yielded up into your hand
The circle of my glory.
Giving the crown
Take again
From this my hand
Your sovereign greatness and authority.
Now keep your holy word: go meet the French
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
Our discontented counties do revolt;
Our people quarrel with obedience
To stranger blood
This inundation of mistemper'd humour
Rests by you only to be qualified:
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick
It was my breath that blew this tempest up
But since you are a gentle convertite
And make fair weather in your blustering land.
On this Ascension-day
Exit
Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
Say that before Ascension-day at noon
My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
I did suppose it should be on constraint:
But
Enter the BASTARD
All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
But Dover castle: London hath received
Your nobles will not hear you
To offer service to your enemy
The little number of your doubtful friends.
Would not my lords return to me again
They found him dead and cast into the streets
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.
That villain Hubert told me he did live.
So
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
Be great in act
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes
The dauntless spirit of resolution.
Away
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
What
O
To meet displeasure farther from the doors
The legate of the pope hath been with me
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
Led by the Dauphin.
O inglorious league!
Shall we
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
Or if he do
They saw we had a purpose of defence.
Have thou the ordering of this present time.
Away
Exeunt
SCENE II. LEWIS's camp at St. Edmundsbury.
Enter
My Lord Melun
Return the precedent to these lords again;
That
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
And
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
To your proceedings; yet believe me
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt
By making many. O
To be a widow-maker! O
Where honourable rescue and defence
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
But such is the infection of the time
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
And is't not pity
Wherein we step after a stranger march
Upon her gentle bosom
Her enemies' ranks
Upon the spot of this enforced cause
To grace the gentry of a land remote
What
That Neptune's arms
Where these two Christian armies might combine
The blood of malice in a vein of league
A noble temper dost thou show in this;
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
O
Between compulsion and a brave respect!
Let me wipe off this honourable dew
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears
But this effusion of such manly drops
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
Lift up thy brow
Commend these waters to those baby eyes
That never saw the giant world enraged;
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts
Come
Into the purse of rich prosperity
As Lewis himself: so
And even there
Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH
Look
And on our actions set the name of right
With holy breath.
Hail
The next is this
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in
Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;
And tame the savage spirit of wild war
Your grace shall pardon me
I am too high-born to be propertied
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
Between this chastised kingdom and myself
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
You taught me how to know the face of right
And come ye now to tell me John hath made
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
I
And
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne
That undergo this charge? who else but I
Have I not heard these islanders shout out
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
Have I not here the best cards for the game
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
No
You look but on the outside of this work.
Outside or inside
Till my attempt so much be glorified
As to my ample hope was promised
Before I drew this gallant head of war
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
Trumpet sounds
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
Enter the BASTARD
According to the fair play of the world
My holy lord of Milan
I come
And
And warrant limited unto my tongue.
The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
By all the blood that ever fury breathed
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
He is prepared
This apish and unmannerly approach
To whip this dwarfish war
That hand which had the strength
In vaults and prisons
Even at the crying of your nation's crow
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers
And you degenerate
Of your dear mother England
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
Like Amazons come tripping after drums
To fierce and bloody inclination.
There end thy brave
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler.
Give me leave to speak.
No
We will attend to neither.
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here.
Indeed your drums
And so shall you
An echo with the clamour of thy drum
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
Sound but another
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
A bare-ribb'd death
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
Strike up our drums
And thou shalt find it
Exeunt
SCENE III. The field of battle.
Alarums. Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT
How goes the day with us? O
Badly
This fever
Enter a Messenger
My lord
And send him word by me which way you go.
Tell him
Be of good comfort; for the great supply
That was expected by the Dauphin here
This news was brought to Richard but even now:
The French fight coldly
Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up
Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;
Weakness possesseth me
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
Enter SALISBURY
I did not think the king so stored with friends.
Up once again; put spirit in the French:
If they miscarry
That misbegotten devil
They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
Enter MELUN
Lead me to the revolts of England here.
When we were happy we had other names.
It is the Count Melun.
Wounded to death.
Fly
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
And welcome home again discarded faith.
Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
For if the French be lords of this loud day
By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
And I with him
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love.
May this be possible? may this be true?
Have I not hideous death within my view
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
What in the world should make me now deceive
Why should I then be false
That I must die here and live hence by truth?
I say again
Behold another day break in the east:
But even this night
Already smokes about the burning crest
Of the old
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
Commend me to one Hubert with your king:
The love of him
In lieu whereof
From forth the noise and rumour of the field
In peace
With contemplation and devout desires.
We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
But I do love the favour and the form
Of this most fair occasion
We will untread the steps of damned flight
And cabby run on in obedience
Even to our ocean
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
Right in thine eye. Away
And happy newness
Exeunt
SCENE V. The French camp.
Enter LEWIS and his train
The sun of heaven methought was loath to set
In faint retire. O
And wound our tattering colours clearly up
Enter a Messenger
Where is my prince
Here: what news?
The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
By his persuasion are again fall'n off
Ah
I did not think to be so sad to-night
As this hath made me. Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
Whoever spoke it
Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
The day shall not be up so soon as I
Exeunt
SCENE VI. An open place in the neighbourhood of Swinstead Abbey.
Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT
Who's there? speak
A friend. What art thou?
Of the part of England.
Whither dost thou go?
What's that to thee? why may not I demand
Of thine affairs
Hubert
Thou hast a perfect thought:
I will upon all hazards well believe
Thou art my friend
Who art thou?
Who thou wilt: and if thou please
I come one way of the Plantagenets.
Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
Have done me shame: brave soldier
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
Come
Why
Brief
O
Show me the very wound of this ill news:
I am no woman
The king
I left him almost speechless; and broke out
To acquaint you with this evil
The better arm you to the sudden time
How did he take it? who did taste to him?
A monk
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.
Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
Why
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them
Withhold thine indignation
I'll tell tree
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
Myself
Away before: conduct me to the king;
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.
Exeunt
SCENE VII. The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.
Enter PRINCE HENRY
It is too late: the life of all his blood
Is touch'd corruptibly
Foretell the ending of mortality.
Enter PEMBROKE
His highness yet doth speak
That
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
Let him be brought into the orchard here.
Doth he still rage?
Exit BIGOT
He is more patient
Than when you left him; even now he sung.
O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
In their continuance will not feel themselves.
Death
Against the mind
With many legions of strange fantasies
should sing.
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
His soul and body to their lasting rest.
Be of good comfort
To set a form upon that indigest
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
Enter Attendants
Ay
It would not out at windows nor at doors.
There is so hot a summer in my bosom
I am a scribbled form
Upon a parchment
Do I shrink up.
How fares your majesty?
Poison'd
And none of you will bid the winter come
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw
Through my burn'd bosom
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much
And so ingrateful
O that there were some virtue in my tears
The salt in them is hot.
Within me is a hell; and there the poison
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
On unreprievable condemned blood.
Enter the BASTARD
O
O cousin
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd
Are turned to one thread
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
And module of confounded royalty.
The Dauphin is preparing hitherward
For in a night the best part of my power
Devoured by the unexpected flood.
KING JOHN dies
You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
My liege! my lord! but now a king
Even so must I run on
What surety of the world
Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
To do the office for thee of revenge
Now
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
Straight let us seek
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
It seems you know not
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest
As we with honour and respect may take
He will the rather do it when he sees
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
Nay
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
To the sea-side
To the disposing of the cardinal:
With whom yourself
To consummate this business happily.
Let it be so: and you
At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
For so he will'd it.
Thither shall it then:
And happily may your sweet self put on
The lineal state and glory of the land!
To whom with all submission
I do bequeath my faithful services
And true subjection everlastingly.
And the like tender of our love we make
I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
And knows not how to do it but with tears.
O
This England never did
Now these her princes are come home again
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. Rome. A street.
Enter FLAVIUS
Hence! home
Is this a holiday? what! know you not
Upon a labouring day without the sign
Of your profession? Speak
Why
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You
Truly
But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
A trade
conscience; which is
What trade
Nay
What meanest thou by that? mend me
Why
Thou art a cobbler
Truly
meddle with no tradesman's matters
matters
to old shoes; when they are in great danger
recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
Truly
into more work. But
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome
You blocks
O you hard hearts
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements
The livelong day
And when you saw his chariot but appear
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
Run to your houses
That needs must light on this ingratitude.
Go
Draw them to Tiber banks
Into the channel
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
Exeunt all the Commoners
See whether their basest metal be not moved;
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
This way will I disrobe the images
May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about
So do you too
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A public place.
Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY
Calpurnia!
Peace
Calpurnia!
Here
Stand you directly in Antonius' way
Caesar
Forget not
I shall remember:
When Caesar says 'do this
Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
Flourish
Caesar!
Ha! who calls?
Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
I hear a tongue
Beware the ides of March.
What man is that?
A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
Set him before me; let me see his face.
Fellow
What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
Beware the ides of March.
He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS
Will you go see the order of the course?
Not I.
I pray you
I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder
I'll leave you.
Brutus
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have:
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.
Cassius
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
Among which number
Nor construe any further my neglect
Then
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value
Tell me
No
'Tis just:
And it is very much lamented
Your hidden worthiness into your eye
And groaning underneath this age's yoke
Into what dangers would you lead me
For that which is not in me?
Therefore
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me
Were I a common laugher
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester; if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout
Flourish
What means this shouting? I do fear
Choose Caesar for their king.
Ay
Then must I think you would not have it so.
I would not
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good
The name of honour more than I fear death.
I know that virtue to be in you
Well
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
We both have fed as well
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
For once
Leap in with me into this angry flood
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd
With lusty sinews
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
But ere we could arrive the point proposed
I
The old Anchises bear
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god
A wretched creature and must bend his body
He had a fever when he was in Spain
How he did shake: 'tis true
His coward lips did from their colour fly
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay
Mark him and write his speeches in their books
As a sick girl. Ye gods
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.
Shout. Flourish
Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
Why
Like a Colossus
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together
Sound them
Weigh them
Now
Rome
When went there by an age
When could they say till now
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough
O
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.
That you do love me
What you would work me to
How I have thought of this and of these times
I will consider; what you have to say
I will with patience hear
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.
I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
The games are done and Caesar is returning.
As they pass by
And he will
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
Re-enter CAESAR and his Train
I will do so. But
Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol
Casca will tell us what the matter is.
Antonius!
Caesar?
Let me have men about me that are fat;
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
Fear him not
He is a noble Roman and well given.
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
Yet if my name were liable to fear
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays
Seldom he smiles
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
That could be moved to smile at any thing.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand
Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train
You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
Ay
Why
I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
Why
offered him
What was the second noise for?
Why
They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
Why
Was the crown offered him thrice?
Ay
time gentler than other
mine honest neighbours shouted.
Who offered him the crown?
Why
Tell us the manner of it
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
neither
you
thinking
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
but
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
refused it
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
for mine own part
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
But
He fell down in the market-place
mouth
'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
No
I know not what you mean by that; but
clap him and hiss him
displeased them
the theatre
What said he when he came unto himself?
Marry
common herd was glad he refused the crown
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
occupation
he fell. When he came to himself again
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
or four wenches
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
stabbed their mothers
And after that
Ay.
Did Cicero say any thing?
Ay
To what effect?
Nay
face again: but those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads; but
part
news too: Marullus and Flavius
off Caesar's images
well. There was more foolery yet
remember it.
Will you sup with me to-night
No
Will you dine with me to-morrow?
Ay
worth the eating.
Good: I will expect you.
Do so. Farewell
Exit
What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
With better appetite.
And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
To-morrow
I will do so: till then
Exit BRUTUS
Well
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
For we will shake him
Exit
SCENE III. The same. A street.
Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides
Good even
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
Are not you moved
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero
Have rived the knotty oaks
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
But never till to-night
Either there is a civil strife in heaven
Why
A common slave--you know him well by sight--
Held up his left hand
Like twenty torches join'd
Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
Against the Capitol I met a lion
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noon-day upon the market-place
Do so conjointly meet
'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
For
Unto the climate that they point upon.
Indeed
But men may construe things after their fashion
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
He doth; for he did bid Antonius
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
Good night then
Is not to walk in.
Farewell
Exit CICERO
Enter CASSIUS
Who's there?
A Roman.
Casca
Your ear is good. Cassius
A very pleasing night to honest men.
Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
The breast of heaven
Even in the aim and very flash of it.
But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
You are dull
That should be in a Roman you do want
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I
Most like this dreadful night
As doth the lion in the Capitol
In personal action
And fearful
'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not
Let it be who it is: for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
But
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
Indeed
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
I know where I will wear this dagger then;
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
Therein
Therein
Nor stony tower
But life
If I know this
I can shake off at pleasure.
Thunder still
So can I:
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.
And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf
He were no lion
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar! But
Before a willing bondman; then I know
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd
You speak to Casca
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold
Be factious for redress of all these griefs
As who goes farthest.
There's a bargain made.
Now know you
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
And I do know
In Pompey's porch: for now
And the complexion of the element
In favour's like the work we have in hand
Stand close awhile
'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
He is a friend.
Enter CINNA
Cinna
To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
No
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for
I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
Yes
O Cassius
But win the noble Brutus to our party--
Be you content: good Cinna
In at his window; set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
To seek you at your house. Well
That done
Exit CINNA
Come
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
Is ours already
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
O
And that which would appear offence in us
Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited. Let us go
We will awake him and be sure of him.
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.
Enter BRUTUS
What
I cannot
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When
Enter LUCIUS
Call'd you
Get me a taper in my study
When it is lighted
I will
Exit
It must be by his death: and for my part
How that might change his nature
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
And then
The abuse of greatness is
Remorse from power: and
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof
But when he once attains the upmost round.
He then unto the ladder turns his back
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
Then
Will bear no colour for the thing he is
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
Which
Re-enter LUCIUS
The taper burneth in your closet
Searching the window for a flint
This paper
Gives him the letter
Get you to bed again; it is not day.
Is not to-morrow
I know not
Look in the calendar
I will
Exit
The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them.
Opens the letter and reads
'Brutus
Shall Rome
Brutus
Such instigations have been often dropp'd
Where I have took them up.
'Shall Rome
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
The Tarquin drive
'Speak
To speak and strike? O Rome
If the redress will follow
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
Re-enter LUCIUS
Sir
Knocking within
'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
Exit LUCIUS
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion
Like a phantasma
The Genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council; and the state of man
The nature of an insurrection.
Re-enter LUCIUS
Sir
Is he alone?
No
Do you know them?
No
By any mark of favour.
Let 'em enter.
Exit LUCIUS
They are the faction. O conspiracy
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none
Hide it in smiles and affability:
For if thou path
To hide thee from prevention.
Enter the conspirators
I think we are too bold upon your rest:
Good morrow
I have been up this hour
Know I these men that come along with you?
Yes
But honours you; and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you.
This is Trebonius.
He is welcome hither.
This
He is welcome too.
This
They are all welcome.
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night?
Shall I entreat a word?
BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper
Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
No.
O
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
You shall confess that you are both deceived.
Here
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire; and the high east
Stands
Give me your hands all over
And let us swear our resolution.
No
If these be motives weak
So let high-sighted tyranny range on
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
The melting spirits of women
Than secret Romans
Than honesty to honesty engaged
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
I think he will stand very strong with us.
Let us not leave him out.
No
O
Will purchase us a good opinion
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
It shall be said
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
O
For he will never follow any thing
That other men begin.
Then leave him out.
Indeed he is not fit.
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
Decius
A shrewd contriver; and
As to annoy us all: which to prevent
Our course will seem too bloody
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
Let us be sacrificers
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
O
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods
And let our hearts
Our purpose necessary and not envious:
Which so appearing to the common eyes
And for Mark Antony
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
When Caesar's head is off.
Yet I fear him;
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
Alas
If he love Caesar
Is to himself
And that were much he should; for he is given
To sports
There is no fear in him; let him not die;
For he will live
Clock strikes
Peace! count the clock.
The clock hath stricken three.
'Tis time to part.
But it is doubtful yet
For he is superstitious grown of late
Of fantasy
It may be
Never fear that: if he be so resolved
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees
But when I tell him he hates flatterers
Let me work;
For I can give his humour the true bent
Nay
By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
Be that the uttermost
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard
I wonder none of you have thought of him.
Now
He loves me well
Send him but hither
The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you
And
What you have said
Good gentlemen
Let not our looks put on our purposes
And so good morrow to you every one.
Exeunt all but BRUTUS
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
Enter PORTIA
Brutus
Portia
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
Nor for yours neither. You've ungently
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head
Yet I insisted
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seem'd too much enkindled
Hoping it was but an effect of humour
It will not let you eat
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition
I am not well in health
Brutus is wise
Why
Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
Of the dank morning? What
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness? No
You have some sick offence within your mind
Which did incorporate and make us one
Have had to resort to you: for here have been
Some six or seven
Even from darkness.
Kneel not
I should not need
Within the bond of marriage
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
But
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more
You are my true and honourable wife
That visit my sad heart
If this were true
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman well-reputed
Think you I am no stronger than my sex
Tell me your counsels
I have made strong proof of my constancy
Here
And not my husband's secrets?
O ye gods
Knocking within
Hark
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart.
All my engagements I will construe to thee
Leave me with haste.
Exit PORTIA
Lucius
Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS
He is a sick man that would speak with you.
Caius Ligarius
Boy
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
O
I am not sick
Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
Such an exploit have I in hand
By all the gods that Romans bow before
Brave son
Thou
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run
Yea
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
But are not some whole that we must make sick?
That must we also. What it is
To whom it must be done.
Set on your foot
That Brutus leads me on.
Follow me
Exeunt
SCENE II. CAESAR's house.
Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out
Enter a Servant
My lord?
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
And bring me their opinions of success.
I will
Exit
Enter CALPURNIA
What mean you
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
The face of Caesar
Caesar
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
And graves have yawn'd
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds
The noise of battle hurtled in the air
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use
What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
When beggars die
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death
Re-enter Servant
What say the augurers?
They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth
The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
No
That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
We are two lions litter'd in one day
And Caesar shall go forth.
Alas
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
That keeps you in the house
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
And he shall say you are not well to-day:
Let me
Mark Antony shall say I am not well
Enter DECIUS BRUTUS
Here's Decius Brutus
Caesar
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
And you are come in very happy time
And tell them that I will not come to-day:
Cannot
I will not come to-day: tell them so
Say he is sick.
Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far
Decius
Most mighty Caesar
The cause is in my will: I will not come;
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
But for your private satisfaction
Calpurnia here
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua
Came smiling
And these does she apply for warnings
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
This dream is all amiss interpreted;
It was a vision fair and fortunate:
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes
Reviving blood
For tinctures
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
And this way have you well expounded it.
I have
And know it now: the senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If you shall send them word you will not come
Apt to be render'd
'Break up the senate till another time
If Caesar hide himself
'Lo
Pardon me
To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
And reason to my love is liable.
How foolish do your fears seem now
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe
Enter PUBLIUS
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
Good morrow
Welcome
What
Good morrow
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is 't o'clock?
Caesar
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
Enter ANTONY
See! Antony
So to most noble Caesar.
Bid them prepare within:
I am to blame to be thus waited for.
Now
I have an hour's talk in store for you;
Remember that you call on me to-day:
Be near me
Caesar
Aside
and so near will I be
Good friends
And we
[Aside]  That every like is not the same
Exeunt
SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.
Enter ARTEMIDORUS
'Caesar
come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna
Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
There is but one mind in all these men
bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal
The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this
If not
Exit
SCENE IV. Another part of the same street
Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS
I prithee
Stay not to answer me
Why dost thou stay?
To know my errand
I would have had thee there
O constancy
I have a man's mind
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?
Madam
Run to the Capitol
And so return to you
Yes
What Caesar doth
Hark
I hear none
Prithee
I heard a bustling rumour
Sooth
Enter the Soothsayer
Come hither
At mine own house
What is't o'clock?
About the ninth hour
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
Madam
Thou hast some suit to Caesar
That I have
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me
Why
None that I know will be
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels
I'll get me to a place more void
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
Exit
I must go in. Ay me
The heart of woman is! O Brutus
Sure
That Caesar will not grant. O
Run
Say I am merry: come to me again
Exeunt severally
ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.
A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the  Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR
[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.
Ay
Hail
Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread
O Caesar
That touches Caesar nearer: read it
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
Delay not
What
Sirrah
What
Come to the Capitol.
CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House
I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
What enterprise
Fare you well.
Advances to CAESAR
What said Popilius Lena?
He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
I fear our purpose is discovered.
Look
Casca
Brutus
Cassius
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
For
Trebonius knows his time; for
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS
Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go
He is address'd: press near and second him.
Casca
Are we all ready? What is now amiss
That Caesar and his senate must redress?
Most high
An humble heart
Kneeling
I must prevent thee
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men
Into the law of children. Be not fond
That will be thaw'd from the true quality
With that which melteth fools; I mean
Thy brother by decree is banished:
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
Know
Will he be satisfied.
Is there no voice more worthy than my own
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
I kiss thy hand
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
What
Pardon
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
I could be well moved
If I could pray to move
But I am constant as the northern star
There is no fellow in the firmament.
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks
So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd
O Caesar
Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
Great Caesar
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
Speak
CASCA first
Et tu
Dies
Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
Run hence
Some to the common pulpits
'Liberty
People and senators
Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
Go to the pulpit
And Cassius too.
Where's Publius?
Here
Stand fast together
Should chance--
Talk not of standing. Publius
There is no harm intended to your person
And leave us
Do so: and let no man abide this deed
Re-enter TREBONIUS
Where is Antony?
Fled to his house amazed:
Men
As it were doomsday.
Fates
That we shall die
And drawing days out
Why
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
Grant that
So are we Caesar's friends
His time of fearing death. Stoop
Up to the elbows
Then walk we forth
Stoop
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport
No worthier than the dust!
So oft as that shall be
The men that gave their country liberty.
What
Ay
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
Enter a Servant
Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
Thus
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
And
Brutus is noble
Caesar was mighty
Say I love Brutus
Say I fear'd Caesar
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
May safely come to him
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
So well as Brutus living; but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
I never thought him worse.
Tell him
I'll fetch him presently.
Exit
I know that we shall have him well to friend.
I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
That fears him much; and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
But here comes Antony.
Re-enter ANTONY
Welcome
O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
Are all thy conquests
I know not
If I myself
As Caesar's death hour
Of half that worth as those your swords
With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye
No place will please me so
O Antony
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel
And this the bleeding business they have done:
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
As fire drives out fire
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part
Our arms
Of brothers' temper
With all kind love
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
In the disposing of new dignities.
Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude
I doubt not of your wisdom.
Let each man render me his bloody hand:
First
Next
Now
Yours
Though last
Gentlemen all
My credit now stands on such slippery ground
That I did love thee
If then thy spirit look upon us now
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand
O world
And this
How like a deer
Mark Antony
Pardon me
The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
Then
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
But what compact mean you to have with us?
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
Or shall we on
Therefore I took your hands
Friends am I with you all and love you all
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
Or else were this a savage spectacle:
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you
That's all I seek:
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the market-place;
And in the pulpit
You shall
Brutus
Aside to BRUTUS
You know not what you do: do not consent
That Antony speak in his funeral:
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter?
By your pardon;
I will myself into the pulpit first
What Antony shall speak
He speaks by leave and by permission
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
I know not what may fall; I like it not.
Mark Antony
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral: and you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going
Be it so.
I do desire no more.
Prepare the body then
Exeunt all but ANTONY
O
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
And Caesar's spirit
Cry  'Havoc
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men
Enter a Servant
You serve Octavius Caesar
I do
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
He did receive his letters
And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
O Caesar!--
Seeing the body
Thy heart is big
Passion
He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
Post back with speed
Here is a mourning Rome
Hie hence
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the market-place: there shall I try
In my oration
The cruel issue of these bloody men;
According to the which
To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.
Exeunt with CAESAR's body
SCENE II. The Forum.
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS
We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
Then follow me
Cassius
Those that will hear me speak
Those that will follow Cassius
And public reasons shall be rendered
Of Caesar's death.
I will hear Brutus speak.
I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons
Exit CASSIUS
The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
Be patient till the last.
Romans
cause
for mine honour
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom
awake your senses
If there be any in this assembly
Caesar's
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar
#NAME?
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves
all free men? As Caesar loved me
as he was fortunate
valiant
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
any
vile that will not love his country? If any
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
None
Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
extenuated
enforced
Enter ANTONY and others
Here comes his body
the benefit of his dying
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
I depart
good of Rome
Live
Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
Give him a statue with his ancestors.
Let him be Caesar.
Caesar's better parts
Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
We'll bring him to his house
With shouts and clamours.
My countrymen
Peace
Peace
Good countrymen
Do grace to Caesar's corpse
Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony
I do entreat you
Exit
Stay
Let him go up into the public chair;
We'll hear him. Noble Antony
For Brutus' sake
Goes into the pulpit
What does he say of Brutus?
He says
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Nay
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
You gentle Romans
Peace
Friends
I come to bury Caesar
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so
Here
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
You all did love him once
What cause withholds you then
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
If thou consider rightly of the matter
Has he
I fear there will a worse come in his place.
Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
If it be found so
Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
Now mark him
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet
Let but the commons hear this testament--
Which
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood
Unto their issue.
We'll hear the will: read it
The will
Have patience
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood
And
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
For
Read the will; we'll hear it
You shall read us the will
Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
I fear I wrong the honourable men
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
They were traitors: honourable men!
The will! the testament!
They were villains
You will compel me
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
Come down.
Descend.
You shall have leave.
ANTONY comes down
A ring; stand round.
Stand from the hearse
Room for Antony
Nay
Stand back; room; bear back.
If you have tears
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening
Look
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd
For Brutus
Judge
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab
And
O
Then I
O
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here
O piteous spectacle!
O noble Caesar!
O woful day!
O traitors
O most bloody sight!
We will be revenged.
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
Let not a traitor live!
Stay
Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
We'll hear him
Good friends
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable:
What private griefs they have
I come not
I am no orator
But
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
For I have neither wit
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
We'll mutiny.
We'll burn the house of Brutus.
Away
Yet hear me
Peace
Why
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas
You have forgot the will I told you of.
Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
Here is the will
To every Roman citizen he gives
Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
O royal Caesar!
Hear me with patience.
Peace
Moreover
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
Never
We'll burn his body in the holy place
Take up the body.
Go fetch fire.
Pluck down benches.
Pluck down forms
Exeunt Citizens with the body
Now let it work. Mischief
Enter a Servant
How now
Sir
Where is he?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
And thither will I straight to visit him:
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry
I heard him say
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
Belike they had some notice of the people
Exeunt
SCENE III. A street.
Enter CINNA the poet
I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar
I have no will to wander forth of doors
Enter Citizens
What is your name?
Whither are you going?
Where do you dwell?
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Answer every man directly.
Ay
Ay
Ay
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then
answer every man directly and briefly
truly: wisely I say
That's as much as to say
you'll bear me a bang for that
Directly
As a friend or an enemy?
As a friend.
That matter is answered directly.
For your dwelling
Briefly
Your name
Truly
Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.
I am Cinna the poet
Tear him for his bad verses
I am not Cinna the conspirator.

Tear him

house
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. A house in Rome.
ANTONY
These many
Your brother too must die; consent you
I do consent--
Prick him down
Upon condition Publius shall not live
He shall not live; look
But
Fetch the will hither
How to cut off some charge in legacies.
What
Or here
Exit LEPIDUS
This is a slight unmeritable man
One of the three to share it?
So you thought him;
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die
Octavius
And though we lay these honours on this man
And having brought our treasure where we will
You may do your will;
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
So is my horse
I do appoint him store of provender:
It is a creature that I teach to fight
And
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
On abjects
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
Therefore let our alliance be combined
And let us presently go sit in council
Let us do so: for we are at the stake
And some that smile have in their hearts
Exeunt
SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.
Drum. Enter BRUTUS
Stand
Give the word
What now
He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master.
He greets me well. Your master
Things done
I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is
He is not doubted. A word
How he received you
With courtesy and with respect enough;
But not with such familiar instances
Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling: ever note
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
But hollow men
But when they should endure the bloody spur
They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
The greater part
Hark! he is arrived.
Low march within
March gently on to meet him.
Enter CASSIUS and his powers
Stand
Stand
Stand!
Stand!
Stand!
Most noble brother
Judge me
And

And when you do them--
Cassius
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here
Then in my tent
Pindarus
A little from this ground.
Lucilius
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
Exeunt
SCENE III. Brutus's tent.
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS
That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein my letters
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offence should bear his comment.
Let me tell you
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.
I an itching palm!
You know that you are Brutus that speak this
The name of Cassius honours this corruption
Chastisement!
Remember March
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touch'd his body
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog
Brutus
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself
To make conditions.
Go to; you are not
I am.
I say you are not.
Urge me no more
Have mind upon your health
Away
Is't possible?
Hear me
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
O ye gods
All this! ay
Go show your slaves how choleric you are
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen
Is it come to this?
You say you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true
You wrong me every way; you wrong me
I said
Did I say 'better'?
If you did
When Caesar lived
Peace
I durst not!
No.
What
For your life you durst not!
Do not presume too much upon my love;
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror
That they pass by me as the idle wind
For certain sums of gold
For I can raise no money by vile means:
By heaven
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection: I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
Dash him to pieces!
I denied you not.
You did.
I did not: he was but a fool that brought
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities
I do not
You love me not.
I do not like your faults.
A friendly eye could never see such faults.
A flatterer's would not
As huge as high Olympus.
Come
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger
Dearer than Plutus' mine
If that thou be'st a Roman
I
Strike
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
Sheathe your dagger:
Be angry when you will
Do what you will
O Cassius
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
Who
Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
When I spoke that
Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
And my heart too.
O Brutus!
What's the matter?
Have not you love enough to bear with me
Makes me forgetful?
Yes
[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;
There is some grudge between 'em
They be alone.
[Within]  You shall not come to them.
[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.
Enter Poet
How now! what's the matter?
For shame
Love
For I have seen more years
Ha
Get you hence
Bear with him
I'll know his humour
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?

Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
And come yourselves
Immediately to us.
Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS
Lucius
Exit LUCIUS
I did not think you could have been so angry.
O Cassius
Of your philosophy you make no use
No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
Ha! Portia!
She is dead.
How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
O insupportable and touching loss!
Upon what sickness?
Impatient of my absence
Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
That tidings came;--with this she fell distract
And died so?
Even so.
O ye immortal gods!
Re-enter LUCIUS
Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
In this I bury all unkindness
My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
Fill
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
Come in
Exit LUCIUS
Re-enter TITINIUS
Welcome
Now sit we close about this taper here
Portia
No more
Messala
Come down upon us with a mighty power
Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
With what addition?
That by proscription and bills of outlawry
Therein our letters do not well agree;
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions
Cicero one!
Cicero is dead
Had you your letters from your wife
No
Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
Nothing
That
Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
No
Now
Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
For certain she is dead
Why
With meditating that she must die once
Even so great men great losses should endure.
I have as much of this in art as you
Well
Of marching to Philippi presently?
I do not think it good.
Your reason?
This it is:
'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
So shall he waste his means
Good reasons must
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection;
For they have grudged us contribution:
The enemy
From which advantage shall we cut him off
Hear me
Under your pardon. You must note beside
The enemy increaseth every day;
We
There is a tide in the affairs of men
Omitted
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves
Then
We'll along ourselves
The deep of night is crept upon our talk
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?
No more. Good night:
Early to-morrow will we rise
Lucius!
Enter LUCIUS
My gown.
Exit LUCIUS
Farewell
Good night
O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night:
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not
Every thing is well.
Good night

Farewell
Exeunt all but BRUTUS

Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
Here in the tent.

Poor knave
Call Claudius and some other of my men:
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
Varro and Claudius!
Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS
Calls my lord?
I pray you
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius.
So please you
I will not have it so: lie down
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
Look
I put it in the pocket of my gown.
VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down
I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
Bear with me
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile
Ay
It does
I trouble thee too much
It is my duty
I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
I have slept
It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
I will not hold thee long: if I do live
Music
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
If thou dost nod
I'll take it from thee; and
Let me see
Where I left reading? Here it is
Enter the Ghost of CAESAR
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
Art thou some god
Speak to me what thou art.
Thy evil spirit
Why comest thou?
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
Well; then I shall see thee again?
Ay
Why
Exit Ghost
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
Ill spirit

Didst thou dream
My lord
Yes
Nothing
Sleep again
To VARRO
Fellow thou
My lord?

It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
They mean to warn us at Philippi here
Tut
Wherefore they do it: they could be content
To visit other places; and come down
With fearful bravery
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
But 'tis not so.
Enter a Messenger
Prepare you
The enemy comes on in gallant show;
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out
Octavius
Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
I do not cross you; but I will do so.
March
Drum. Enter BRUTUS
They stand
Stand fast
Mark Antony
No
Make forth; the generals would have some words.
Stir not until the signal.
Words before blows: is it so
Not that we love words better
Good words are better than bad strokes
In your bad strokes
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart
Antony
But for your words
Not stingless too.
O
For you have stol'n their buzzing
Villains
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
You show'd your teeth like apes
Whilst damned Casca
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
Flatterers! Now
This tongue had not offended so to-day
Come
I draw a sword against conspirators;
When think you that the sword goes up again?
Never
Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
Caesar
So I hope;
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
O
A peevish schoolboy
Old Cassius still!
Come
Defiance
If you dare fight to-day
If not

Why
The storm is up
Ho
"[Standing forth]	My lord?"
BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart
Messala!
[Standing forth]  What says my general?
Messala
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand
Be thou my witness that against my will
Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion: now I change my mind
Coming from Sardis
Two mighty eagles fell
Who to Philippi here consorted us:
This morning are they fled away and gone;
And in their steads do ravens
A canopy most fatal
Our army lies
Believe not so.
I but believe it partly;
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly.
Even so
Now
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain
If we do lose this battle
The very last time we shall speak together:
What are you then determined to do?
Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself
The time of life: arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below.
Then
Thorough the streets of Rome?
No
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun;
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
For ever
If we do meet again
If not
For ever
If we do meet again
If not
Why
The end of this day's business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end

My life is run his compass. Sirrah

What news?
[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about
With horsemen
Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
Now
He's ta'en.
Shout
And
Come down
O
PINDARUS descends

In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
And then I swore thee
Now be a freeman: and with this good sword
Stand not to answer: here

Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power
These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
Where did you leave him?

Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?
He lies not like the living. O my heart!
Is not that he?
No
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;

Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
O hateful error
The things that are not? O error

Into his ears; I may say
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight.

Why didst thou send me forth
Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
Put on my brows this wreath of victory

But
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee
Will do his bidding. Brutus

Come
Kills himself
Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA

Lo
Titinius' face is upward.
He is slain.
O Julius Caesar
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails.
Low alarums
Brave Titinius!
Look
Are yet two Romans living such as these?
The last of all the Romans
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow. Friends
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time
Come
His funerals shall not be in our camp
And come

'Tis three o'clock; and
We shall try fortune in a second fight.

Kill Brutus
We must not. A noble prisoner!

I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
Enter ANTONY
Brutus is ta'en
Where is he?
Safe
I dare assure thee that no enemy
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
The gods defend him from so great a shame!
When you do find him
This is not Brutus
Give him all kindness: I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
How every thing is chanced.

Sit thee down
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee
Whispers

Peace then! no words.
I'll rather kill myself.
Hark thee
Whispers
Shall I do such a deed?
O Dardanius!
O Clitus!
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
To kill him
Now is that noble vessel full of grief
Come hither
What says my lord?
Why
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
Two several times by night; at Sardis once
I know my hour is come.
Not so
Nay
Thou seest the world
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
Low alarums
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
Even for that our love of old
That's not an office for a friend
Alarum still
Fly
Farewell to you; and you; and you
Strato
Farewell to thee too
I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
Hath almost ended his life's history:
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest
Alarum. Cry within
Fly
Hence! I will follow.
Exeunt CLITUS
I prithee
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
Hold then my sword
Give me your hand first. Fare you well
Farewell
Runs on his sword

I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
Dies
Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS
What man is that?
My master's man. Strato
Free from the bondage you are in
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
For Brutus only overcame himself
So Brutus should be found. I thank thee
All that served Brutus
Fellow
Ay
Do so
How died my master
I held the sword
Octavius
This was the noblest Roman of them all:
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
He only
And common good to all
His life was gentle
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
According to his virtue let us use him
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie
So call the field to rest; and let's away

ACT I
SCENE I. King Lear's palace.
Enter KENT
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
Albany than Cornwall.
It did always seem so to us: but now
division of the kingdom
the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
weighed
of either's moiety.
Is not this your son
His breeding
so often blushed to acknowledge him
brazed to it.
I cannot conceive you.
Sir
she grew round-wombed
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
Do you smell a fault?
I cannot wish the fault undone
being so proper.
But I have

Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age;
Conferring them on younger strengths
Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall
Our daughters' several dowers
May be prevented now. The princes
Since now we will divest us both of rule
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril
Sir
Dearer than eye-sight
Beyond what can be valued
No less than life
As much as child e'er loved
A love that makes breath poor
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?
Love
Of all these bounds
Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter
Sir
Of the self-same metal that my sister is
I find she names my very deed of love;
Only she comes too short: that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness' love.
"[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!"
And yet not so; since
More richer than my tongue.
To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
No less in space
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
Nothing
Nothing!
Nothing.
Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
Unhappy that I am
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
According to my bond; nor more nor less.
How
Good my lord
Return those duties back as are right fit
Why have my sisters husbands
They love you all? Haply
Half my love with him
Sure
But goes thy heart with this?
Ay
So young
So young
Let it be so; thy truth
For
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist
Here I disclaim all my paternal care
Hold thee
To gorge his appetite
Be as well neighbour'd
Good my liege
Peace
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most
On her kind nursery. Hence
So be my grave my peace
Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany
Let pride
I do invest you jointly with my power
That troop with majesty. Ourself
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
The name
The sway
Giving the crown
Royal Lear
The bow is bent and drawn
Let it fall rather
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
And
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
Reverbs no hollowness.
Kent
My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it
Out of my sight!
See better
The true blank of thine eye.
Now
Now
O
Laying his hand on his sword
Dear sir
Do:
Kill thy physician
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
Or
Hear me
On thine allegiance
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow
To come between our sentence and our power
Five days we do allot thee
To shield thee from diseases of the world;
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom: if
Fare thee well

Thus Kent
He'll shape his old course in a country new.

Here's France and Burgundy
My lord of Burgundy.
We first address towards you
Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what
Most royal majesty
Right noble Burgundy
But now her price is fall'n. Sir
If aught within that little seeming substance
I know no answer.
Will you
Pardon me
Election makes not up on such conditions.
Then leave her
To KING OF FRANCE
For you
To avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
Almost to acknowledge hers.
This is most strange
Commit a thing so monstrous
So many folds of favour. Sure
Must be of such unnatural degree
Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her
Could never plant in me.
I yet beseech your majesty
If for I want that glib and oily art
It is no vicious blot
But even for want of that for which I am richer
As I am glad I have not
Hath lost me in your liking.
Better thou
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
Is it but this
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy
When it is mingled with regards that stand
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
She is herself a dowry.
Royal Lear
Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
I am sorry
That you must lose a husband.
Peace be with Burgundy!
Since that respects of fortune are his love
Fairest Cordelia
Most choice
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
Gods
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
Thy dowerless daughter
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
Bid them farewell
Thou losest here
Thou hast her
Have no such daughter
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
Without our grace
Come
Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE
Bid farewell to your sisters.
The jewels of our father
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
To your professed bosoms I commit him
But yet
So
Prescribe not us our duties.
Let your study
Be to content your lord
At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted
Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
Who cover faults
Well may you prosper!
Come
Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA
Sister
most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
father will hence to-night.
That's most certain
You see how full of changes his age is; the
observation we have made of it hath not been
little: he always loved our sister most; and
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
appears too grossly.
'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
but slenderly known himself.
The best and soundest of his time hath been but
rash; then must we look to receive from his age
condition
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
him as this of Kent's banishment.
There is further compliment of leavetaking
between France and him. Pray you
together: if our father carry authority with
such dispositions as he bears
surrender of his will but offend us.
We shall further think on't.
We must do something

[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes

Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright:
As you are old and reverend
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
Men so disorder'd
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy: be then desired
By her
And the remainder
Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses; call my train together:
Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
Yet have I left a daughter.
You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
Make servants of their betters.
Enter ALBANY
Woe
To ALBANY
O
Is it your will? Speak
Ingratitude
Than the sea-monster!
Pray
[To GONERIL]  Detested kite! thou liest.
My train are men of choice and rarest parts
The worships of their name. O most small fault
That
From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love
Beat at this gate
And thy dear judgment out! Go
My lord
Of what hath moved you.
It may be so
Hear
Suspend thy purpose
To make this creature fruitful!
Into her womb convey sterility!
Dry up in her the organs of increase;
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her! If she must teem
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
To have a thankless child! Away
Exit
Now
Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
But let his disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it.
Re-enter KING LEAR
What
Within a fortnight!
What's the matter
I'll tell thee:
To GONERIL
Life and death! I am ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
That these hot tears
The untented woundings of a father's curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes
Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter
When she shall hear this of thee
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever: thou shalt
Exeunt KING LEAR
Do you mark that
I cannot be so partial
Pray you

You
Nuncle Lear

A fox
So the fool follows after.
Exit
This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights: yes
Well
Safer than trust too far:
Let me still take away the harms I fear
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
If she sustain him and his hundred knights
When I have show'd the unfitness
Re-enter OSWALD
How now
What
Yes
Take you some company
Inform her full of my particular fear;
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more. Get you gone;
And hasten your return.
Exit OSWALD
No
Though I condemn not
Than praised for harmful mildness.
How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
Striving to better
Nay
Well
Exeunt
SCENE V. Court before the same.
Enter KING LEAR
Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
If your diligence be not speedy
I will not sleep
your letter.
Exit
If a man's brains were in's heels
danger of kibes?
Ay
Then
slip-shod.
Ha
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
apple
Why
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
the middle on's face?
No.
Why
what a man cannot smell out
I did her wrong--
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
No.
Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
Why?
Why
daughters
I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
horses ready?
Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
Because they are not eight?
Yes
To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
If thou wert my fool
for being old before thy time.
How's that?
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
been wise.
O
Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
Enter Gentleman
How now! are the horses ready?
Ready
Come
She that's a maid now

Save thee
And you
given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
his duchess will be here with him this night.
How comes that?
Nay
I mean the whispered ones
ear-kissing arguments?
"Not I	pray you"
Have you heard of no likely wars toward
Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
Not a word.
You may do

The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother;
And I have one thing
Brother
Enter EDGAR
My father watches: O sir
Intelligence is given where you are hid;
You have now the good advantage of the night:
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
He's coming hither: now
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
Advise yourself.
I am sure on't
I hear my father coming: pardon me:
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
Yield: come before my father. Light
Fly

Wounds his arm
Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
Do more than this in sport. Father

Now
Here stood he in the dark
To stand auspicious mistress
But where is he?
Look
Where is the villain
Fled this way
Pursue him
Exeunt some Servants
By no means what?
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
But that I told him
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
Spoke
The child was bound to the father; sir
To his unnatural purpose
My unprovided body
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits
Let him fly far:
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master
By his authority I will proclaim it
He that conceals him
When I dissuaded him from his intent
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied
Of any trust
Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny
As this I would: ay
My very character
To thy suggestion
And thou must make a dullard of the world
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.'
Strong and fasten'd villain
Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
Tucket within
Hark
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
The duke must grant me that: besides
I will send far and near
May have the due note of him; and of my land
To make thee capable.
Enter CORNWALL
How now
If it be true
Which can pursue the offender. How dost
O
What
He whom my father named? your Edgar?
O
Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father?
I know not
Yes
No marvel
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions
Nor I

A child-like office.
'Twas my duty
He did bewray his practise; and received
This hurt you see
Is he pursued?
Ay
If he be taken
Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose
So much commend itself
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
You we first seize on.
I shall serve you
For him I thank your grace.
You know not why we came to visit you
Thus out of season
Occasions
Our father he hath writ
To answer from our home; the several messengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend
Your needful counsel to our business
I serve you
Your graces are right welcome.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.
Enter KENT and OSWALD
Good dawning to thee
Ay.
Where may we set our horses?
I' the mire.
Prithee
I love thee not.
Why
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold
care for me.
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
Fellow
What dost thou know me for?
A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
base
lily-livered
one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
bawd
the composition of a knave
will beat into clamorous whining
the least syllable of thy addition.
Why
on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou
knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
thy heels
rogue: for

Keep peace
He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
The messengers from our sister and the king.
What is your difference? speak.
I am scarce in breath
No marvel
cowardly rascal
tailor made thee.
Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
Ay
not have made him so ill
hours at the trade.
Speak yet
This ancient ruffian
at suit of his gray beard
Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
lord
unbolted villain into mortar
a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard
Peace
You beastly knave
Yes
Why art thou angry?
That such a slave as this should wear a sword
Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel;
Bring oil to fire
Renege
With every gale and vary of their masters
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Smile you my speeches
Goose
Why
How fell you out? say that.
No contraries hold more antipathy
Than I and such a knave.
Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?
His countenance likes me not.
No more
Sir
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant.
This is some fellow
A saucy roughness
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter
An they will take it
These kind of knaves I know
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
Than twenty silly ducking observants
That stretch their duties nicely.
Sir
On flickering Phoebus' front
What mean'st by this?
To go out of my dialect
discommend so much. I know
flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
accent was a plain knave; which for my part
I will not be
to entreat me to 't.
What was the offence you gave him?
I never gave him any:
It pleased the king his master very late
To strike at me
When he
For him attempting who was self-subdued;
And
None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool.
Fetch forth the stocks!
You stubborn ancient knave
Sir
Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
On whose employment I was sent to you:
You shall do small respect
Against the grace and person of my master
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour
Till noon! till night
Why
Sir
This is a fellow of the self-same colour
Our sister speaks of. Come
Stocks brought out
Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
His fault is much
Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
For pilferings and most common trespasses
Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill
I'll answer that.
My sister may receive it much more worse
KENT is put in the stocks
Come
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT
I am sorry for thee
Pray
Some time I shall sleep out
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
Give you good morrow!
The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.
Exit
Good king
To the warm sun!
Approach
Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia
Of my obscured course; and shall find time
From this enormous state
Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd
This shameful lodging.
Fortune
Sleeps
SCENE III. A wood.
Enter EDGAR
I heard myself proclaim'd;
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury
Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
And with presented nakedness out-face
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars
Pins
And with this horrible object
That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.
Exit
SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.
Enter KING LEAR
'Tis strange that they should so depart from home
As I learn'd
Of this remove.
Hail to thee
Ha!
Makest thou this shame thy pastime?
No
Ha
by the heads
the loins
over-lusty at legs
nether-stocks.
What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here?
It is both he and she;
Your son and daughter.
No.
Yes.
No
I say
No
Yes
By Jupiter
By Juno
They durst not do 't;
They could not
Resolve me
Thou mightst deserve
My lord
I did commend your highness' letters to them
My duty kneeling
From Goneril his mistress salutations;
Deliver'd letters
Commanded me to follow
The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
And meeting here the other messenger
Being the very fellow that of late
Display'd so saucily against your highness
Having more man than wit about me
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers.
Winter's not gone yet
Fathers that wear rags
Do make their children blind;
But fathers that bear bags
Shall see their children kind.
Fortune
But
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
O
Hysterica passio
With the earl
Follow me not;
Stay here.
Exit
Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
None.
How chance the king comes with so small a train?
And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
question
Why
We'll set thee to school to an ant
there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
runs down a hill
following it: but the great one that goes up the
hill
gives thee better counsel
would have none but knaves follow it
That sir which serves and seeks for gain
The knave turns fool that runs away;
The fool no knave
Where learned you this
Not i' the stocks
Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER
Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
The images of revolt and flying off.
Fetch me a better answer.
My dear lord
How unremoveable and fix'd he is
In his own course.
Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
Fiery? what quality? Why
Well
Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me
Ay
The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
Would with his daughter speak
Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
No
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
When nature
To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
And am fall'n out with my more headier will
For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore
Looking on KENT
Should he sit here? This act persuades me
That this remotion of the duke and her
Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them
Till it cry sleep to death.
I would have all well betwixt you.
Exit
O me
Cry to it
when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em
o' the coxcombs with a stick
kindness to his horse
Enter CORNWALL
Good morrow to you both.
Hail to your grace!
KENT is set at liberty
I am glad to see your highness.
Regan
I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad
To KENT
O
Some other time for that. Beloved Regan
Sharp-tooth'd unkindness
Points to his heart
I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
I pray you
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty.
Say
I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation: if
She have restrain'd the riots of your followers
My curses on her!
O
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
By some discretion
Better than you yourself. Therefore
Say you have wrong'd her
Ask her forgiveness?
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
'Dear daughter
Kneeling
Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment
Good sir
Return you to my sister.
[Rising]  Never
She hath abated me of half my train;
Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones
Fie
You nimble lightnings
Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty
O the blest gods! so will you wish on me
No
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures
Against my coming in: thou better know'st
The offices of nature
Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot
Good sir
Who put my man i' the stocks?
Tucket within
What trumpet's that?
I know't
Enter OSWALD
Is your lady come?
This is a slave
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
Out
What means your grace?
Who stock'd my servant? Regan
Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens
If you do love old men
Allow obedience
To GONERIL
Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
O Regan
Why not by the hand
All's not offence that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so.
O sides
Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?
I set him there
Deserved much less advancement.
You! did you?
I pray you
If
I am now from home
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
Return to her
No
To wage against the enmity o' the air;
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl
Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
Why
Our youngest born
To knee his throne
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom.
Pointing at OSWALD
At your choice
I prithee
I will not trouble thee
We'll no more meet
But yet thou art my flesh
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh
Let shame come when it will
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan
Not altogether so:
I look'd not for you yet
For your fit welcome. Give ear
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old
But she knows what she does.
Is this well spoken?
I dare avouch it
Is it not well? What should you need of more?
Yea
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How
Why might not you
From those that she calls servants or from mine?
Why not
For now I spy a danger
To bring but five and twenty: to no more
Will I give place or notice.
I gave you all--
And in good time you gave it.
Made you my guardians
But kept a reservation to be follow'd
With such a number. What
With five and twenty
And speak't again
Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
Stands in some rank of praise.
To GONERIL
I'll go with thee:
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty
Hear me
What need you five and twenty
Have a command to tend you?
What need one?
O
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
Allow not nature more than nature needs
If only to go warm were gorgeous
You heavens
You see me here
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
Against their father
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger
What they are
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
No
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
Exeunt KING LEAR
Storm and tempest
Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
This house is little: the old man and his people
Cannot be well bestow'd.
'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
For his particular
So am I purposed.
Where is my lord of Gloucester?
Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
Re-enter GLOUCESTER
The king is in high rage.
Whither is he going?
He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.
'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
My lord
Alack
Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout
There's scarce a bush.
O
Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
He is attended with a desperate train;
And what they may incense him to
To have his ear abused
Shut up your doors
My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.
Exeunt
ACT III
SCENE I. A heath.
Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman
Who's there
One minded like the weather
I know you. Where's the king?
Contending with the fretful element:
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea
Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
This night
Keep their fur dry
But who is with him?
None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
His heart-struck injuries.
Sir
And dare
With mutual cunning
Who have--as who have not
Throned and set high?--servants
Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen
Against the old kind king; or something deeper
But
Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already
In some of our best ports
To show their open banner. Now to you:
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover
Some that will thank you
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The king hath cause to plain.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
And
This office to you.
I will talk further with you.
No
For confirmation that I am much more
Than my out-wall
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia
As fear not but you shall
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
I will go seek the king.
Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
Few words
That
That way
Holla the other.
Exeunt severally
SCENE II. Another part of the heath. Storm still.
Enter KING LEAR and Fool
Blow
You cataracts and hurricanoes
Till you have drench'd our steeples
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires
Crack nature's moulds
O nuncle
house is better than this rain-water out o' door.
Good nuncle
here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit
Nor rain
I tax not you
I never gave you kingdom
Your horrible pleasure: here I stand
But yet I call you servile ministers
Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!
He that has a house to put's head in has a good
head-piece.
The cod-piece that will house
Before the head has any
So beggars marry many.
The man that makes his toe
What he his heart should make
Shall of a corn cry woe
For there was never yet fair woman but she made
mouths in a glass.
No
I will say nothing.
Enter KENT
Who's there?
Marry
man and a fool.
Alas
Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
The affliction nor the fear.
Let the great gods
Thou perjured
That art incestuous: caitiff
Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts
These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
More sinn'd against than sinning.
Alack
Gracious my lord
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
Repose you there; while I to this hard house--
More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
Which even but now
Their scanted courtesy.
My wits begin to turn.
Come on
I am cold myself. Where is this straw
The art of our necessities is strange
Poor fool and knave
That's sorry yet for thee.
[Singing]
He that has and a little tiny wit--
With hey
Must make content with his fortunes fit
TRUE
Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT
This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
When priests are more in word than matter;
When brewers mar their malt with water;
When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
No heretics burn'd
When every case in law is right;
No squire in debt
When slanders do not live in tongues;
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
And bawds and whores do churches build;
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion:
Then comes the time
This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

displeasure
him
Most savage and unnatural!
Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have
received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be
spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:
these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
home; there's part of a power already footed: we
must incline to the king. I will seek him
privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
the duke
if he ask for me. I am ill
Though I die for it
some strange thing toward
Exit
This courtesy
Instantly know; and of that letter too:
This seems a fair deserving
That which my father loses; no less than all:
The younger rises when the old doth fall.
Exit
SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel.
Enter KING LEAR
Here is the place
The tyranny of the open night's too rough
For nature to endure.
Storm still
Let me alone.
Good my lord
Wilt break my heart?
I had rather break mine own. Good my lord
Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
But where the greater malady is fix'd
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea
mind's free
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:
No
To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
In such a night as this! O Regan
Your old kind father
O
No more of that.
Good my lord
Prithee
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
To the Fool
In
Nay
Fool goes in
Poor naked wretches
From seasons such as these? O
Too little care of this! Take physic
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel
[Within]  Fathom and half
The Fool runs out from the hovel
Come not in here
Help me
Give me thy hand. Who's there?
A spirit
What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
Come forth.
Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man
Away! the foul fiend follows me!
Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
Hum! go to thy cold bed
Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
And art thou come to this?
Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
fiend hath led through fire and through flame
through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
that hath laid knives under his pillow
in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
proud of heart
four-inched bridges
traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold
de
charity
have him now
Storm still
What
Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?
Nay
Now
Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
He hath no daughters
Death
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
Is it the fashion
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
Those pelican daughters.
Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
Halloo
This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
array. Tom's a-cold.
What hast thou been?
A serving-man
my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
my mistress' heart
her; swore as many oaths as I spake words
broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
slept in the contriving of lust
wine loved I deeply
out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart
ear
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
out of brothels
from lenders' books
Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
Says suum
Dolphin my boy
Storm still
Why
with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
owest the worm no silk
no wool
's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare
come unbutton here.

This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins

He met the night-mare
Bid her alight
How fares your grace?
What's he?
Who's there? What is't you seek?
What are you there? Your names?
Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog
the fury of his heart
the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
tithing
hath had three suits to his back
body
But mice and rats
Beware my follower. Peace

The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
Modo he's call'd
Our flesh and blood is grown so vile
Poor Tom's a-cold.
Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
Though their injunction be to bar my doors
First let me talk with this philosopher.
What is the cause of thunder?
Good my lord
I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
What is your study?
How to prevent the fiend
Let me ask you one word in private.
Importune him once more to go
His wits begin to unsettle.
Canst thou blame him?
Storm still
His daughters seek his death: ah
He said it would be thus
Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee
No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee
I do beseech your grace
O
Noble philosopher

I now perceive
brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;

badness in himself.
How malicious is my fortune
be just! This is the letter he spoke of
approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
of France: O heavens! that this treason were not

If the matter of this paper be certain
mighty business in hand.
True or false
Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is
may be ready for our apprehension.
[Aside]  If I find him comforting the king
stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
my course of loyalty
between that and my blood.
I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
dearer father in my love.

Frateretto calls me; and tells me
Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.

No

Wantest thou eyes at trial
Come o'er the bourn
Her boat hath a leak
Why she dares not come over to thee.
The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
white herring. Croak not
food for thee.
How do you
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
To EDGAR
Thou robed man of justice
To the Fool
And thou

you are o' the commission
Let us deal justly.
Sleepest or wakest thou
Thy sheep be in the corn;
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth

Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my

She cannot deny it.
Cry you mercy

Good friend
I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
There is a litter ready; lay him in 't
Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
If thou shouldst dally half an hour
And follow me
Give thee quick conduct.
Oppressed nature sleeps:
This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses

Come
Thou must not stay behind.
Come
Exeunt all but EDGAR

Hang him instantly.
Pluck out his eyes.
Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund

To this chair bind him. Villain
REGAN plucks his beard
By the kind gods
To pluck me by the beard.
So white
Naughty lady
With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
Come
Be simple answerer
And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Late footed in the kingdom?
To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.
I have a letter guessingly set down
Cunning.
And false.
Where hast thou sent the king?
To Dover.
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--
Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
I am tied to the stake
Wherefore to Dover
Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
The sea
In hell-black night endured
Yet
If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time
All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
The winged vengeance overtake such children.
See't shalt thou never. Fellows
Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
He that will think to live till he be old
One side will mock another; the other too.
If you see vengeance
Hold your hand
I have served you ever since I was a child;
But better service have I never done you
Than now to bid you hold.
How now
If you did wear a beard upon your chin
My villain!
They draw and fight
Nay
Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
Takes a sword
O
To see some mischief on him. O!
Dies
Lest it see more
Where is thy lustre now?
All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
Edmund
Out
Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
Who is too good to pity thee.
O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
Kind gods
Go thrust him out at gates
His way to Dover.
Exit one with GLOUCESTER
How is't
I have received a hurt: follow me
Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
Upon the dunghill. Regan
Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
Exit CORNWALL
I'll never care what wickedness I do
If she live long
Let's follow the old earl

Allows itself to any thing.

To apply to his bleeding face. Now

The lamentable change is from the best;
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome

Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?

My father
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee
O
your father's tenant
Away
Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
Thee they may hurt.
Alack
I have no way
I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen
Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar
Might I but live to see thee in my touch
How now! Who's there?
[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
the worst'?
I am worse than e'er I was.
'Tis poor mad Tom.
[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
So long as we can say  'This is the worst.'
Fellow
Is it a beggar-man?
Madman and beggar too.
He has some reason
I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
Which made me think a man a worm: my son
Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
more since.
As flies to wanton boys
They kill us for their sport.
"[Aside]	How should this be?"
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow
Is that the naked fellow?
Ay
Then
And bring some covering for this naked soul
Alack

Do as I bid thee
Above the rest
I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have

Know'st thou the way to Dover?

Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
thee
fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust
Obidicut; Hobbididence
stealing; Modo
mopping and mowing
and waiting-women. So
Here
Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
Makes thee the happier: heavens
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man
Because he doth not feel
So distribution should undo excess
Ay
There is a cliff
Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
Bring me but to the very brim of it
With something rich about me: from that place
I shall no leading need.
Give me thy arm:
Poor Tom shall lead thee.

I told him of the army that was landed;
He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
What like
[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
May prove effects. Back
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
I must change arms at home
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear
Giving a favour
Decline your head: this kiss
Conceive
Yours in the ranks of death.
My most dear Gloucester!
Exit EDMUND
O
To thee a woman's services are due:
My fool usurps my body.
Madam
Exit
Enter ALBANY
I have been worth the whistle.
O Goneril!
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
That nature
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap
And come to deadly use.
No more; the text is foolish.
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
Tigers
A father
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
A man
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences
Milk-liver'd man!
That bear'st a cheek for blows
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
Whiles thou
'Alack
See thyself
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman.
O vain fool!
Thou changed and self-cover'd thing
To let these hands obey my blood
Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend
Marry
Enter a Messenger
What news?
O
Slain by his servant
The other eye of Gloucester.
Gloucester's eye!
A servant that he bred
To his great master; who
But not without that harmful stroke
Hath pluck'd him after.
This shows you are above
So speedily can venge! But
Lost he his other eye?
Both

'Tis from your sister.
[Aside]              One way I like this well;
But being widow
Upon my hateful life: another way
Exit
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
Come with my lady hither.
He is not here.
No
Knows he the wickedness?
Ay
And quit the house on purpose
Might have the freer course.

To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king
Tell me what more thou know'st.
Exeunt
SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.
Enter KENT and a Gentleman
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
know you the reason?
Something he left imperfect in the
state
of; which imports to the kingdom so much
fear and danger
most required and necessary.
Who hath he left behind him general?
The Marshal of France
Did your letters pierce the queen to any
demonstration of grief?
Ay
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
Over her passion; who
O
Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
Were like a better way: those happy smilets
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence
Made she no verbal question?
'Faith
Pantingly forth
Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
Kent! father! sisters! What
Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
The holy water from her heavenly eyes
To deal with grief alone.
It is the stars
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
No.
Was this before the king return'd?
No
Well
Who sometime
What we are come about
Will yield to see his daughter.
Why
A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness
To foreign casualties
To his dog-hearted daughters
His mind so venomously
Detains him from Cordelia.
Alack
Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
'Tis so
Well
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
When I am known aright
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you
Along with me.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The same. A tent.

In the restoring his bereaved sense?
He that helps him take all my outward worth.
There is means
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose
Will close the eye of anguish.
All blest secrets
In the good man's distress! Seek
Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it.
Enter a Messenger
News
The British powers are marching hitherward.
'Tis known before; our preparation stands
In expectation of them. O dear father
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
No blown ambition doth our arms incite
Soon may I hear and see him!
Exeunt
SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.
Enter REGAN and OSWALD
But are my brother's powers set forth?
Ay
Himself in person there?
Madam
Your sister is the better soldier.
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
No
What might import my sister's letter to him?
I know not
'Faith
It was great ignorance
All hearts against us: Edmund
His nighted life: moreover
The strength o' the enemy.
I must needs after him
Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
The ways are dangerous.
I may not
My lady charged my duty in this business.
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
Transport her purposes by word? Belike
Madam
I know your lady does not love her husband;
I am sure of that: and at her late being here
She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
I
I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:
Therefore I do advise you
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
If you do find him
And when your mistress hears thus much from you
So
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor
Would I could meet him
What party I do follow.
Fare thee well.
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.
Enter GLOUCESTER
When shall we come to the top of that same hill?
You do climb up it now: look
Methinks the ground is even.
Horrible steep.
Hark
No
Why
By your eyes' anguish.
So may it be
Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
But in my garments.
Methinks you're better spoken.
Come on
And dizzy 'tis
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
Hangs one that gathers samphire
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
The fishermen
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge
Lest my brain turn
Topple down headlong.
Set me where you stand.
Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
Would I not leap upright.
Let go my hand.
Here
Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;
Bid me farewell
Now fare you well
With all my heart.
Why I do trifle thus with his despair
Is done to cure it.
[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!
This world I do renounce
If I could bear it longer
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills
Burn itself out. If Edgar live
Now
He falls forward
Gone
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought
Ho
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
What are you
Away
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer
Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
But have I fall'n
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
Alack
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit
Give me your arm:
Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
Too well
This is above all strangeness.
Upon the crown o' the cliff
Which parted from you?
A poor unfortunate beggar.
As I stood here below
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses
It was some fiend; therefore
Of men's impossibilities
I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
Affliction till it do cry out itself
'Enough
'The fiend
Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
Enter KING LEAR
The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
His master thus.
No
king himself.
O thou side-piercing sight!
Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look
cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O
flown
Give the word.
Sweet marjoram.
Pass.
I know that voice.
Ha! Goneril
me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
wet me once
the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
found 'em
not men o' their words: they told me I was every
thing; 'tis a lie
The trick of that voice I do well remember:
Is 't not the king?
Ay
When I do stare
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
The wren goes to 't
Does lecher in my sight.
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
To 't
Behold yond simpering dame
That minces virtue
To hear of pleasure's name;
The fitchew
With a more riotous appetite.
Down from the waist they are Centaurs
But to the girdle do the gods inherit
There's hell
sulphurous pit
there's money for thee.
O
Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
at me? No
love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
penning of it.
Were all the letters suns
I would not take this from report; it is
Read.
What
O
head
a heavy case
this world goes.
I see it feelingly.
What
with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark
thine ear: change places; and
is the justice
a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
Ay
And the creature run from the cur? There thou
mightst behold the great image of authority: a
dog's obeyed in office.
Thou rascal beadle
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold
Arm it in rags
None does offend
Take that of me
To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
And like a scurvy politician
To see the things thou dost not. Now
Pull off my boots: harder
O
If thou wilt weep my fortunes
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
Thou know'st
Alack
When we are born
To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
It were a delicate stratagem
A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law
Enter a Gentleman
O
No rescue? What
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
I am cut to the brains.
You shall have any thing.
No seconds? all myself?

Good sir
I will die bravely
I will be jovial: come
You are a royal one
Then there's life in't. Nay
shall get it with running. Sa
Exit running; Attendants follow
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch
Which twain have brought her to.
Hail
Sir
Do you hear aught
Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that
But
Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
Stands on the hourly thought.
I thank you
Though that the queen on special cause is here
I thank you
Exit Gentleman

Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
To die before you please!

A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!

To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor
That must destroy thee.
Now let thy friendly hand
Put strength enough to't.

Wherefore
Lest that the infection of his fortune take
Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
Ch'ill not let go

As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire.

May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
He had no other death's-man. Let us see:

Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
Have in thy reverence made!
Kind and dear princess!
Had you not been their father
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
To be opposed against the warring winds?
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
In the most terrible and nimble stroke
Of quick
With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog
Against my fire; and wast thou fain
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
Madam
How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire
Do scald like moulten lead.
Sir
You are a spirit
Still
He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity
I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
Of my condition!
O
No
Pray
I am a very foolish fond old man
And
Methinks I should know you
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is; and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
For
To be my child Cordelia.
And so I am
Be your tears wet? yes
If you have poison for me
I know you do not love me; for your sisters
Have
You have some cause
No cause
Am I in France?
In your own kingdom
Do not abuse me.
Be comforted
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
Till further settling.
Will't please your highness walk?
You must bear with me:
Pray you now
Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman
Holds it true
Most certain
Who is conductor of his people?
As 'tis said
They say Edgar
of Kent in Germany.

SCENE I. The British camp
Enter
Know of the duke if his last purpose hold
To change the course: he's full of alteration
And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.
To a Gentleman
Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
'Tis to be doubted
Now
Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth
In honour'd love.
But have you never found my brother's way
To the forfended place?
That thought abuses you.
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
And bosom'd with her
No
I never shall endure her: dear my lord
Fear me not:
She and the duke her husband!

[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister
Should loosen him and me.
Our very loving sister
Sir
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest
Sir
Why is this reason'd?
Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
For these domestic and particular broils
Are not the question here.
Let's then determine
With the ancient of war on our proceedings.
I shall attend you presently at your tent.
Sister
No.
'Tis most convenient; pray you
[Aside]  O
As they are going out
If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor
I'll overtake you. Speak.
Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR
Before you fight the battle
If you have victory
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem
What is avouched there. If you miscarry
Stay till I have read the letter.

To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
Each jealous of the other
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd

Some officers take them away: good guard
That are to censure them.
We are not the first

For thee
Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
No
We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
When thou dost ask me blessing
At gilded butterflies
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too
And take upon's the mystery of things
Take them away.
Upon such sacrifices
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
The good-years shall devour them
first. Come.
Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA
Come hither
Take thou this note;
Giving a paper
go follow them to prison:
One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
As this instructs thee
To noble fortunes: know thou this
Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
Does not become a sword: thy great employment
Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't
I'll do 't
About it; and write happy when thou hast done.

Exit
Flourish. Enter ALBANY
Sir
That were the opposites of this day's strife:
We do require them of you
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine.
Sir
To send the old and miserable king
To some retention and appointed guard;
Whose age has charms in it
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
My reason all the same; and they are ready
To-morrow
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
And the best quarrels
By those that feel their sharpness:
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place.
Sir
That's as we list to grace him.
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
Bore the commission of my place and person;
The which immediacy may well stand up
Not so hot:
In his own grace he doth exalt himself
In my rights
That were the most
Jesters do oft prove prophets.

Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund
On capital treason; and
Pointing to Goneril
For your claim
'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord
If you will marry
An interlude!
Thou art arm'd
If none appear to prove upon thy head
Thy heinous
Throwing down a glove
I'll prove it on thy heart
Than I have here proclaim'd thee.

There's my exchange:
Throwing down a glove

That names me traitor
Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach
My truth and honour firmly.

Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers
Took their discharge.

Come hither

Trumpet answers within
Enter EDGAR
Ask him his purposes
Upon this call o' the trumpet.
What are you?
Your name
This present summons?
Know
By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope.
Which is that adversary?
What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
Himself: what say'st thou to him?
Draw thy sword
Behold
False to thy gods
Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
And
To the descent and dust below thy foot
This sword
To prove upon thy heart
In wisdom I should ask thy name;
But
By rule of knighthood
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
Which
Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls
Save him
This is practise
By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd
Shut your mouth
Thou worse than any name
No tearing
Gives the letter to EDMUND
Say
Who can arraign me for't.
Most monstrous! oh!
Know'st thou this paper?
Ask me not what I know.
Exit
Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.

And more
'Tis past
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble
Let's exchange charity.
I am no less in blood than thou art
If more
My name is Edgar
The gods are just
Make instruments to plague us:
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes.
Thou hast spoken right
The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
Let sorrow split my heart
Did hate thee or thy father!
Worthy prince
Where have you hid yourself?
How have you known the miseries of your father?
By nursing them
And when 'tis told
The bloody proclamation to escape
That we the pain of death would hourly die
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
Met I my father with his bleeding rings
Never
Not sure
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart
'Twixt two extremes of passion
This speech of yours hath moved me
You look as you had something more to say.
If there be more
For I am almost ready to dissolve
This would have seem'd a period
To such as love not sorrow; but another
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man
Who 'twas that so endured
He fastened on my neck
As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
That ever ear received: which in recounting
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded
But who was this?
Kent
Follow'd his enemy king
Improper for a slave.
Enter a Gentleman
Help
What kind of help?
Speak
What means that bloody knife?
'Tis hot
It came even from the heart of--O
Who dead? speak
Your lady
By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
I was contracted to them both: all three
Now marry in an instant.
Here comes Kent.
Produce their bodies
This judgment of the heavens
Exit Gentleman

O
The time will not allow the compliment
Which very manners urges.
I am come
To bid my king and master aye good night:
Is he not here?
Great thing of us forgot!
Speak
See'st thou this object
The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in
Alack
Yet Edmund was beloved:
The one the other poison'd for my sake
Even so. Cover their faces.
I pant for life: some good I mean to do
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
Nay
Run
To who
Thy token of reprieve.
Well thought on: take my sword
Haste thee
Exit EDGAR
He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison
To lay the blame upon her own despair
The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
EDMUND is borne off
Re-enter KING LEAR
Howl
Had I your tongues and eyes
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
I know when one is dead
She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone
Is this the promised end
Or image of that horror?
Fall
This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so
That ever I have felt.
[Kneeling]  O my good master!
Prithee
'Tis noble Kent
A plague upon you
I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
Cordelia
What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
'Tis true
Did I not
I have seen the day
I would have made them skip: I am old now
Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
If fortune brag of two she loved and hated
This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

He'll strike
No
I'll see that straight.

That we present us to him.
Very bootless.

That's but a trifle here.
You lords and noble friends
What comfort to this great decay may come
Shall be applied: for us we will resign

Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
The wages of their virtue
The cup of their deservings. O
And my poor fool is hang'd! No
Why should a dog

Break
Look up
Vex not his ghost: O

Stretch him out longer.
He is gone
The wonder is
He but usurp'd his life.
Bear them from hence. Our present business
Is general woe.
To KENT and EDGAR

ACT I
SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.
Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre
Let fame
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore
And the huge army of the world's desires
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe
You three
My fellow-scholars
That are recorded in this schedule here:
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names
That violates the smallest branch herein:
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do
I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
The mind shall banquet
Fat paunches have lean pates
Make rich the ribs
My loving lord
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
To love
With all these living in philosophy.
I can but say their protestation over;
So much
But there are other strict observances;
As
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside
And then
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
O
Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
Let me say no
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years' space.
You swore to that
By yea and nay
What is the end of study? let me know.
Why
Things hid and barr'd
Ay
Come on
As thus
Or study where to meet some mistress fine
Or
If study's gain be thus and this be so
Swear me to this
These be the stops that hinder study quite
And train our intellects to vain delight.
Why
As
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
So
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others' books
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.
How well he's read
Proceeded well
He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
How follows that?
Fit in his place and time.
In reason nothing.
Something then in rhyme.
Biron is like an envious sneaping frost
Well
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you
Well
No
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
[Reads]  'Item
mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
Four days ago.
Let's see the penalty.
Reads
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
Marry
Sweet lord
To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
A dangerous law against gentility!
Reads
'Item
within the term of three years
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
This article
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit
Therefore this article is made in vain
What say you
So study evermore is overshot:
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should
We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.
Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born
If I break faith
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
So to the laws at large I write my name:
Subscribes
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe
But is there no quick recreation granted?
Ay
With a refined traveller of Spain;
A man in all the world's new fashion planted
One whom the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
A man of complements
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
This child of fancy
In high-born words the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
How you delight
But
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

how can that be true love which is falsely
attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
tempted
Solomon so seduced
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.

The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss
Whose edge hath power to cut
It should none spare that come within his power.
Some merry mocking lord
They say so most that most his humours know.
Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
Who are the rest?
The young Dumain
Most power to do most harm
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.
Another of these students at that time
Was there with him
Biron they call him; but a merrier man
His eye begets occasion for his wit;
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
God bless my ladies! are they all in love
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
Here comes Boyet.
Re-enter BOYET
Now
Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
And he and his competitors in oath
Were all address'd to meet you
He rather means to lodge you in the field
Here comes Navarre.
Enter FERDINAND
Fair princess
'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
You shall be welcome
I will be welcome
Hear me
Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
Not for the world
Why
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
Were my lord so
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
Madam
You will the sooner
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
I know you did.
How needless was it then to ask the question!
You must not be so quick.
'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
Your wit's too hot
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
What time o' day?
The hour that fools should ask.
Now fair befall your mask!
Fair fall the face it covers!
And send you many lovers!
Amen
Nay
Madam
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars.
But say that he or we
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied
But that
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess
From reason's yielding
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again.
You do the king my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
I do protest I never heard of it;
And if you prove it
Or yield up Aquitaine.
We arrest your word.
Boyet
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father.
Satisfy me so.
So please your grace
Where that and other specialties are bound:
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
It shall suffice me: at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour without breach of honour may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
You may not come
But here without you shall be so received
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart
Your own good thoughts excuse me
To-morrow shall we visit you again.
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!

And wherefore not ships?
No sheep
You sheep
So you grant pasture for me.
Offering to kiss her
Not so
My lips are no common
Belonging to whom?
To my fortunes and me.
Good wits will be jangling; but
This civil war of wits were much better used
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.
If my observation
With what?
With that which we lovers entitle affected.
Your reason?
Why
To the court of his eye
His heart
His tongue
All senses to that sense did make their repair
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye
Who
His face's own margent did quote such amazes
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his
Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.
I only have made a mouth of his eye
Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
Then was Venus like her mother
Do you hear
No.

That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack
No face is fair that is not full so black.
O paradox! Black is the badge of hell
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
Devils soonest tempt
O
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
Her favour turns the fashion of the days
And therefore red
To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
And since her time are colliers counted bright.
And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.

Consider what you first did swear unto
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.

And abstinence engenders maladies.
And where that you have vow'd to study
For when would you
Without the beauty of a woman's face?
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;  They are the ground
Why
The nimble spirits in the arteries
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
Now
And study too
For where is any author in the world
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is:
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes
O
For when would you
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
And therefore
But love
But
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
For valour
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
As bright Apollo's lute
And when Love speaks
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
O
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
They are the books
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
Then fools you were these women to forswear
For wisdom's sake
It is religion to be thus forsworn
Saint Cupid
Advance your standards
Pell-mell
Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
And win them too: therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents.
First
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them
For revels
Forerun fair Love
Away
That will betime
Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
And justice always whirls in equal measure:
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
If so

SCENE II. The same.
Enter the PRINCESS
Sweet hearts
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
Look you what I have from the loving king.
Madame
Nothing but this! yes
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper
That was the way to make his godhead wax
Ay
You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.
He made her melancholy
And so she died: had she been light
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
What's your dark meaning
A light condition in a beauty dark.
We need more light to find your meaning out.
You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
Look what you do
So do not you
Indeed I weigh not you
You weigh me not? O
Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
But Rosaline
Who sent it? and what is it?
I would you knew:
An if my face were but as fair as yours
Nay
The numbers true; and
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
O
Any thing like?
Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
'Ware pencils
O
A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
But
Madam
Did he not send you twain?
Yes
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover
This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
The letter is too long by half a mile.
I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short?
Ay
We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
O that I knew he were but in by the week!
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
That he should be my fool and I his fate.
None are so surely caught
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As foolery in the wise
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove
Here comes Boyet
Enter BOYET
O
Thy news Boyet?
Prepare
Arm
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards
Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? say
Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When
The king and his companions: warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by
Their herald is a pretty knavish page
Action and accent did they teach him there;
'Thus must thou speak
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out
Yet fear not thou
The boy replied
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that
One rubb'd his elbow thus
A better speech was never spoke before;
Another
The third he caper'd
The fourth turn'd on the toe
With that
But what
They do
Like Muscovites or Russians
Their purpose is to parle
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress
By favours several which they did bestow.
And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
For
And not a man of them shall have the grace
Hold
Hold
And change your favours too; so shall your loves
Woo contrary
Come on
But in this changing what is your intent?
The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
They do it but in mocking merriment;
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook
Upon the next occasion that we meet
But shall we dance
No
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace
Why
Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown
So shall we stay
Trumpets sound within
The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.

True; out indeed.
Out of your favours
Not to behold--

Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes

You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

Is this your perfectness? be gone

What would they
Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
Why
She says
Say to her
To tread a measure with her on this grass.
They say
To tread a measure with you on this grass.
It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile: if they have measured many
If to come hither you have measured miles
How many inches doth fill up one mile.
Tell her
She hears herself.
How many weary steps
We number nothing that we spend for you:
Our duty is so rich
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
My face is but a moon
Blessed are clouds
Vouchsafe
O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
Then
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
Play
Music plays
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
You took the moon at full
Yet still she is the moon
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
Our ears vouchsafe it.
But your legs should do it.
Since you are strangers and come here by chance
Why take we hands
Only to part friends:
Curtsy
More measure of this measure; be not nice.
We can afford no more at such a price.
Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
Your absence only.
That can never be.
Then cannot we be bought: and so
Twice to your visor
If you deny to dance
In private
I am best pleased with that.

As is the razor's edge invisible
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows

In their own shapes; for it can never be

To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
Nor God
Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
Now by my maiden honour

So much I hate a breaking cause to be

We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour
I dare not call them fools; but this I think
This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
This proves you wise and rich
I am a fool
But that you take what doth to you belong
O
All the fool mine?
I cannot give you less.
Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?

Bruise me with scorn
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance
O
Taffeta phrases
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them; and I here protest
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
And
My love to thee is sound
Sans sans
Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage: bear with me
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft

They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
They have the plague

Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.

Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
Nor shall not
Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
Teach us
Some fair excuse.
The fairest is confession.
Were not you here but even now disguised?
Madam
And were you well advised?
I was
When you then were here
That more than all the world I did respect her.
When she shall challenge this
Upon mine honour
Peace
Your oath once broke
Despise me
I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline

As precious eyesight
Above this world; adding thereto moreover
That he would wed me
God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
Most honourably doth unhold his word.
What mean you
By heaven
My faith and this the princess I did give:
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
Pardon me
And Lord Biron
What
Neither of either; I remit both twain.
I see the trick on't: here was a consent
Some carry-tale
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed
Now
Much upon this it is: and might not you

Forestall our sport
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier
And stand between her back

Exeunt Worthies
How fares your majesty?
Boyet
Madam
Prepare
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits
In the converse of breath: your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
Excuse me so
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed
That which long process could not arbitrate:
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince
From what it purposed; since
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
I understand you not: my griefs are double.
Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the king.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time
Even to the opposed end of our intents:
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous
As love is full of unbefitting strains
To every varied object in his glance:
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false
To those that make us both
And even that falsehood
We have received your letters full of love;
Your favours
And
At courtship
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion
Our letters
So did our looks.
We did not quote them so.
Now
A time
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No
If for my love
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
If frosts and fasts
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
Then
I will be thine; and till that instant shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house
For the remembrance of my father's death.
If this thou do deny
If this
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
But what to me
A beard
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
O
Not so
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
Come when the king doth to my lady come;
Then
I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
Yet swear not
What says Maria?
At the twelvemonth's end
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
The liker you; few taller are so young.
Studies my lady? mistress
Behold the window of my heart
Impose some service on me for thy love.
Oft have I heard of you
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible:
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
Why
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it
Of him that makes it: then
But if they will not
A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall
[To FERDINAND]  Ay
No
Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
Might well have made our sport a comedy.
Come
That's too long for a play.

And Marian's nose looks red and raw

ACT I
SCENE I. A desert place.
Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches
When shall we three meet again
In thunder
When the hurlyburly's done
That will be ere the set of sun.
Where the place?
Upon the heath.
There to meet with Macbeth.
I come
Paddock calls.
Anon.
Fair is foul
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A camp near Forres.
Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN
What bloody man is that? He can report
The newest state.
This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.
Doubtful it stood;
As two spent swimmers
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
Worthy to be a rebel
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And fortune
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
Disdaining fortune
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
Discomfort swells. Mark
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels
Began a fresh assault.
Dismay'd not this
Our captains
Yes;
As sparrows eagles
If I say sooth
As cannons overcharged with double cracks
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
But I am faint
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
Exit Sergeant
Who comes here?
Enter ROSS
The worthy thane of Ross.
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
That seems to speak things strange.
God save the king!
Whence camest thou
From Fife
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold. Norway himself
The thane of Cawdor
Till that Bellona's bridegroom
Curbing his lavish spirit: and
Great happiness!
That now
Sweno
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death
I'll see it done.
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.
Exeunt
SCENE III. A heath near Forres.
Thunder. Enter the three Witches
Where hast thou been
Killing swine.
Sister
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap
'Give me
'Aroint thee
Her husband's to Aleppo gone
But in a sieve I'll thither sail
I'll give thee a wind.
Thou'rt kind.
And I another.
I myself have all the other
I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
He shall live a man forbid:
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle
Though his bark cannot be lost
Look what I have.
Show me
Here I have a pilot's thumb
Drum within
A drum
Macbeth doth come.
The weird sisters
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again
Peace! the charm's wound up.
Enter MACBETH and BANQUO
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire
That man may question? You seem to understand me
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women
That you are so.
Speak
All hail
All hail
All hail
Good sir
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope
If you can look into the seeds of time
Your favours nor your hate.
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
Lesser than Macbeth
Not so happy
Thou shalt get kings
So all hail
Banquo and Macbeth
Stay
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives
Stands not within the prospect of belief
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak
Witches vanish
The earth hath bubbles
Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?
Your children shall be kings.
You shall be king.
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
Enter ROSS and ANGUS
The king hath happily received
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that
Came post with post; and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
Only to herald thee into his sight
And
In which addition
For it is thine.
What
The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?
Who was the thane lives yet;
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
With those of Norway
With hidden help and vantage
He labour'd in his country's wreck
But treasons capital
[Aside]  Glamis
The greatest is behind.
To ROSS and ANGUS
Thanks for your pains.
To BANQUO
Do you not hope your children shall be kings
Promised no less to them?
That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown
And oftentimes
In deepest consequence.
Cousins
"[Aside]	Two truths are told"
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you
Aside
Cannot be ill
If good
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
Are less than horrible imaginings:
My thought
Is smother'd in surmise
But what is not.
Look
[Aside]  If chance will have me king
New horrors come upon him
But with the aid of use.
[Aside]                Come what come may
Worthy Macbeth
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced
Our free hearts each to other.
Very gladly.
Till then
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.
Flourish. Enter DUNCAN
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet return'd?
My liege
With one that saw him die: who did report
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons
A deep repentance: nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it; he died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
There's no art
To find the mind's construction in the face:
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.
Enter MACBETH
O worthiest cousin!
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved
Might have been mine! only I have left to say
The service and the loyalty I owe
Is to receive our duties; and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants
Safe toward your love and honour.
Welcome hither:
I have begun to plant thee
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo
No less to have done so
And hold thee to my heart.
There if I grow
My plenteous joys
In drops of sorrow. Sons
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
Not unaccompanied invest him only
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness
The rest is labour
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So humbly take my leave.
My worthy Cawdor!
[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
On which I must fall down
Let not light see my black and deep desires:
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be
Exit
TRUE
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him
It is a peerless kinsman.
Flourish. Exeunt
SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.
Enter LADY MACBETH
'They met me in the day of success: and I have
learned by the perfectest report
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further
the wonder of it
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title
me to the coming on of time
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
thee
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
to thy heart
Glamis thou art
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round
To have thee crown'd withal.
Enter a Messenger
What is your tidings?
The king comes here to-night.
Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who
So please you
One of my fellows had the speed of him
Than would make up his message.
Give him tending;
He brings great news.
Exit Messenger
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come
That tend on mortal thoughts
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse
Shake my fell purpose
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts
You wait on nature's mischief! Come
Enter MACBETH
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present
The future in the instant.
My dearest love
And when goes hence?
To-morrow
O
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face
May read strange matters. To beguile the time
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
We will speak further.
Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.
Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN
This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.
This guest of summer
Smells wooingly here: no jutty
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
Where they most breed and haunt
Enter LADY MACBETH
See
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains
All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old
Where's the thane of Cawdor?
We coursed him at the heels
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
And his great love
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess
Your servants ever
Have theirs
Give me your hand;
Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly
By your leave
Exeunt
SCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.
Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer
If it were done when 'tis done
It were done quickly: if the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
First
Hath borne his faculties so meek
So clear in his great office
Will plead like angels
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity
Upon the sightless couriers of the air
To prick the sides of my intent
Vaulting ambition
And falls on the other.
Enter LADY MACBETH
How now! what news?
He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
Hath he ask'd for me?
Know you not he has?
We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people
Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
And wakes it now
At what it did so freely? From this time
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life
Like the poor cat i' the adage?
Prithee
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.
What beast was't
When you durst do it
And
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Did then adhere
They have made themselves
Does unmake you. I have given suck
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
I would
Have done to this.
If we should fail?
We fail!
But screw your courage to the sticking-place
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers
Of our great quell?
Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males. Will it not be received
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers
Who dares receive it other
Upon his death?
I am settled
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.
Enter BANQUO
How goes the night
The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
And she goes down at twelve.
I take't
Hold
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me
Gives way to in repose!
Enter MACBETH
Give me my sword.
Who's there?
A friend.
What
He hath been in unusual pleasure
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal
In measureless content.
Being unprepared
Which else should free have wrought.
All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
To you they have show'd some truth.
I think not of them:
Yet
At your kind'st leisure.
If you shall cleave to my consent
So I lose none
In seeking to augment it
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear
Good repose the while!
Thanks
Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE
Go bid thy mistress
Exit Servant
Is this a dagger which I see before me
I have thee not
Art thou not
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind
I see thee yet
As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
Nature seems dead
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecate's offerings
With Tarquin's ravishing strides
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
A bell rings
I go
Hear it not
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
Exit
SCENE II. The same.
Enter LADY MACBETH
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
their possets
[Within]  Who's there? what
Alack
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept
Enter MACBETH
My husband!
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
When?
Now.
As I descended?
Ay.
Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?
Donalbain.
This is a sorry sight.
Looking on his hands
A foolish thought
There's one did laugh in's sleep
'Murder!'
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
But they did say their prayers
Again to sleep.
There are two lodged together.
One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
Listening their fear
When they did say 'God bless us!'
Consider it not so deeply.
But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
I had most need of blessing
Stuck in my throat.
These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep'
What do you mean?
Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
Who was it that thus cried? Why
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.
I'll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look on't again I dare not.
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed
For it must seem their guilt.
Exit. Knocking within
Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand? No
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine
Re-enter LADY MACBETH
My hands are of your colour; but I shame
To wear a heart so white.
Knocking within
I hear a knocking
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it
Hath left you unattended.
Knocking within
Hark! more knocking.
Get on your nightgown
So poorly in your thoughts.
To know my deed
Knocking within
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!
Exeunt
SCENE III. The same.
Knocking within. Enter a Porter
Here's a knocking indeed! If a
man were porter of hell-gate
old turning the key.
Knocking within
Knock
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
time; have napkins enow about you; here
you'll sweat for't.
Knocking within
Knock
name? Faith
swear in both the scales against either scale;
who committed treason enough for God's sake

Knocking within
Knock
English tailor come hither
a French hose: come in

Knock
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
it no further: I had thought to have let in
some of all professions that go the primrose
way to the everlasting bonfire.
Knocking within
Anon
Opens the gate
Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX
Was it so late
'Faith sir
second cock: and drink
provoker of three things.
What three things does drink especially provoke?
Marry
urine. Lechery
it provokes the desire
away the performance: therefore
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
it makes him
him on
not stand to; in conclusion
in a sleep
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
That it did
me: but I requited him for his lie; and
think
up my legs sometime
him.
Is thy master stirring?
Enter MACBETH
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
Good morrow
Good morrow
Is the king stirring
Not yet.
He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.
I'll bring you to him.
I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
But yet 'tis one.
The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.
I'll make so bold to call
Exit
Goes the king hence to-day?
He does: he did appoint so.
The night has been unruly: where we lay
Of dire combustion and confused events
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say
Was feverous and did shake.
'Twas a rough night.
My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it.
Re-enter MACDUFF
O horror
Cannot conceive nor name thee!
What's the matter.
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lord's anointed temple
The life o' the building!
What is 't you say? the life?
Mean you his majesty?
Approach the chamber
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
See
Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX
Awake
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
Shake off this downy sleep
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
As from your graves rise up
Bell rings

What's the business
The sleepers of the house? speak
O gentle lady
The repetition
Enter BANQUO
O Banquo
Woe
What
Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff
Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX
Had I but died an hour before this chance
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The wine of life is drawn
Is left this vault to brag of.
Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN
What is amiss?
You are
The spring
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
Your royal father 's murder'd.
O
Those of his chamber
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
So were their daggers
Upon their pillows:
They stared
Was to be trusted with them.
O
Wherefore did you so?
Who can be wise
The expedition my violent love
Outrun the pauser
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain
Courage to make 's love kno wn?
Help me hence
Look to the lady.
[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues
[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here
Let 's away;
Our tears are not yet brew'd.
[Aside to DONALBAIN]        Nor our strong sorrow
Upon the foot of motion.
Look to the lady:
LADY MACBETH is carried out
And when we have our naked frailties hid
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.
And so do I.
So all.
Let's briefly put on manly readiness
Well contented.
Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
To Ireland
Shall keep us both the safer: where we are
This murderous shaft that's shot
Hath not yet lighted
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking
Which steals itself
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.
Enter ROSS and an old Man
Threescore and ten I can remember well:
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings.
Ah
Is't night's predominance
'Tis unnatural
And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
Beauteous and swift
War with mankind.
'Tis said they eat each other.
They did so
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
Enter MACDUFF
How goes the world
Why
Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
Those that Macbeth hath slain.
Alas
What good could they pretend?
They were suborn'd:
Malcolm and Donalbain
Suspicion of the deed.
'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
He is already named
To be invested.
Where is Duncan's body?
Carried to Colmekill
Will you to Scone?
No
Well
Well
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

Thou hast it now: king
It should not stand in thy posterity
Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
As upon thee
Why
Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH
Here's our chief guest.
If he had been forgotten
To-night we hold a solemn supper sir
Let your highness
Command upon me; to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.
Ride you this afternoon?
Ay
We should have else desired your good advice
Is't far you ride?
As far
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better
For a dark hour or twain.
Fail not our feast.
My lord
We hear
In England and in Ireland
Their cruel parricide
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu
Ay
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.
Exit BANQUO
Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night: to make society
The sweeter welcome
Till supper-time alone: while then
Exeunt all but MACBETH
Sirrah
Our pleasure?
They are
Bring them before us.
Exit Attendant
To be thus is nothing;
But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
And
To act in safety. There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and
When first they put the name of king upon me
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man
Rather than so
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
Re-enter Attendant
Now go to the door
Exit Attendant
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
It was
Well then
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune
Our innocent self: this I made good to you
In our last conference
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'
You made it known to us.
I did so
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
To pray for this good man and for his issue
And beggar'd yours for ever?
We are men
Ay
As hounds and greyhounds
All by the name of dogs: the valued file
Distinguishes the swift
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Particular addition. from the bill
That writes them all alike: and so of men.
Now
And I will put that business in your bosoms
I am one
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.
And I another
So weary with disasters
Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.
TRUE
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is
For sundry weighty reasons.
We shall
Though our lives--
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time
That I require a clearness: and with him--
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
Fleance his son
Than is his father's
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
I'll come to you anon.
We are resolved
I'll call upon you straight: abide within.

Say to the king
For a few words.

Nought's had
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
Enter MACBETH
How now
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done.
We have scotch'd the snake
She'll close and be herself
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint
worlds suffer
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel
Come on;
Gentle my lord
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
So shall I
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
Present him eminence
Unsafe the while
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams
You must leave this.
O
Thou know'st that Banquo
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal
A deed of dreadful note.
What's to be done?
Be innocent of the knowledge
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So
Exeunt
SCENE III. A park near the palace.
Enter three Murderers
But who did bid thee join with us?
Macbeth.
He needs not our mistrust
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
Now spurs the lated traveller apace
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
The subject of our watch.
Hark! I hear horses.
[Within]  Give us a light there
Then 'tis he: the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i' the court.
His horses go about.
Almost a mile: but he does usually
Make it their walk.
A light
Enter BANQUO
'Tis he.
Stand to't.
It will be rain to-night.
Let it come down.
They set upon BANQUO
O
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
Dies. FLEANCE escapes
Who did strike out the light?
Wast not the way?
There's but one down; the son is fled.
We have lost
Best half of our affair.
Well
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.
A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH
You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
And last the hearty welcome.
Thanks to your majesty.
Ourself will mingle with society
Our hostess keeps her state
We will require her welcome.
Pronounce it for me
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
First Murderer appears at the door
See
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
The table round.
Approaching the door
There's blood on thy face.
'Tis Banquo's then.
'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?
My lord
Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it
Most royal sir
Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect
But now I am cabin'd
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?
Ay
The least a death to nature.
Thanks for that:
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed
We'll hear
Exit Murderer
My royal lord
That is not often vouch'd
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.
Sweet remembrancer!
Now
May't please your highness sit.
The GHOST OF BANQUO enters
Here had we now our country's honour roof'd
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance!
His absence
To grace us with your royal company.
The table's full.
Here is a place reserved
Where?
Here
Which of you have done this?
What
Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
Thy gory locks at me.
Gentlemen
Sit
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well: if much you note him
Feed
Ay
Which might appal the devil.
O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear:
This is the air-drawn dagger which
A woman's story at a winter's fire
Why do you make such faces? When all's done
Prithee
how say you?
Why
If charnel-houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back
Shall be the maws of kites.
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
What
If I stand here
Fie
Blood hath been shed ere now
Ay
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been
Than such a murder is.
My worthy lord
I do forget.
Do not muse at me
To those that know me. Come
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table
Would he were here! to all
Our duties
Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO
Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with!
Think of this
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
What man dare
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear
Take any shape but that
Shall never tremble: or be alive again
If trembling I inhabit then
The baby of a girl. Hence
Unreal mockery
GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
Why
You have displaced the mirth
Can such things be
Even to the disposition that I owe
What sights
I pray you
Question enrages him. At once
Stand not upon the order of your going
Good night; and better health
Attend his majesty!
A kind good night to all!
Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH
It will have blood; they say
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
Augurs and understood relations have
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?
Almost at odds with morning
How say'st thou
At our great bidding?
Did you send to him
I hear it by the way; but I will send:
There's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know
Stepp'd in so far that
Strange things I have in head
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
You lack the season of all natures
Come
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
We are yet but young in deed.
Exeunt
SCENE V. A Heath.
Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE
Why
Have I not reason
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death;
And I
And
Hath been but for a wayward son
But make amends now: get you gone
Meet me i' the morning: thither he
Will come to know his destiny:
Your vessels and your spells provide
I am for the air; this night I'll spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
Great business must be wrought ere noon:
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
And that distill'd by magic sleights
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion:
He shall spurn fate
He hopes 'bove wisdom
And you all know
Is mortals' chiefest enemy.
Music and a song within: 'Come away
Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit
Exit
Come
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.
Enter LENNOX and another Lord
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts
gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
Whom
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear
Was not that nobly done? Ay
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
To hear the men deny't. So that
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
As
should find
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
But
His presence at the tyrant's feast
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir
Where he bestows himself?
The son of Duncan
Lives in the English court
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
That
To ratify the work--we may again
Give to our tables meat
All which we pine for now: and this report
Hath so exasperate the king that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.
Sent he to Macduff?
He did: and with an absolute 'Sir
The cloudy messenger turns me his back
That clogs me with this answer.'
And that well might
Advise him to a caution
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursed!
I'll send my prayers with him.
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle
Thunder. Enter the three Witches
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
Harpier cries 'Tis time
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison'd entrails throw.
Toad
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelter'd venom sleeping got
Double
Fire burn
Fillet of a fenny snake
Eye of newt and toe of frog
Double
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Scale of dragon
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark
Silver'd in the moon's eclipse
Ditch-deliver'd by a drab
Add thereto a tiger's chaudron
Double
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
Cool it with a baboon's blood
Enter HECATE to the other three Witches
O well done! I commend your pains;
And every one shall share i' the gains;
And now about the cauldron sing
Music and a song: 'Black spirits
HECATE retires
By the pricking of my thumbs
Open
Enter MACBETH
How now
What is't you do?
A deed without a name.
I conjure you
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together
To what I ask you.
Speak.
Demand.
We'll answer.
Say
Call 'em; let me see 'em.
Pour in sow's blood
Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
From the murderer's gibbet throw
Into the flame.
Come
Thyself and office deftly show!
Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head
Tell me
He knows thy thought:
Hear his speech
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
Descends
Whate'er thou art
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
word more
He will not be commanded: here's another
Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
Had I three ears
Be bloody
The power of man
Shall harm Macbeth.
Descends
Then live
But yet I'll make assurance double sure
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies
Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king
And top of sovereignty?
Listen
Be lion-mettled
Who chafes
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him.
Descends
That will never be
Who can impress the forest
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
Rebellion's head
Of Birnam rise
Shall live the lease of nature
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?
Seek to know no more.
I will be satisfied: deny me this
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
Hautboys
Show!
Show!
Show!
Show his eyes
Come like shadows
A show of Eight Kings
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start
What
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
And yet the eighth appears
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
Horrible sight! Now
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me
Apparitions vanish
What
Ay
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come
I'll charm the air to give a sound
That this great king may kindly say
Music. The witches dance and then vanish
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
Come in
Enter LENNOX
What's your grace's will?
Saw you the weird sisters?
No
Came they not by you?
No
Infected be the air whereon they ride;
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
'Tis two or three
Macduff is fled to England.
Fled to England!
Ay
Time
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
His wife
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
Come
Exeunt
SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.
Enter LADY MACDUFF
What had he done
You must have patience
He had none:
His flight was madness: when our actions do not
You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
Wisdom! to leave his wife
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren
All is the fear and nothing is the love;
As little is the wisdom
So runs against all reason.
My dearest coz
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
much further;
But cruel are the times
And do not know ourselves
From what we fear
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
Things at the worst will cease
To what they were before. My pretty cousin
Father'd he is
I am so much a fool
I take my leave at once.
Exit
Sirrah
And what will you do now? How will you live?
As birds do
What
With what I get
Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime
Why should I
My father is not dead
Yes
Nay
Why
Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet
Was my father a traitor
Ay
What is a traitor?
Why
And be all traitors that do so?
Every one that does so is a traitor
And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
Every one.
Who must hang them?
Why
Then the liars and swearers are fools
the honest men and hang up them.
Now
But how wilt thou do for a father?
If he were dead
him: if you would not
that I should quickly have a new father.
Poor prattler
Enter a Messenger
Bless you
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
If you will take a homely man's advice
To fright you thus
To do worse to you were fell cruelty
I dare abide no longer.
Exit
Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
Is often laudable
Accounted dangerous folly: why then
Enter Murderers
What are these faces?
Where is your husband?
I hope
Where such as thou mayst find him.
He's a traitor.
Thou liest
What
Stabbing him
Young fry of treachery!
He has kill'd me
Run away
Dies
Exit LADY MACDUFF
SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.
Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF
Let us seek out some desolate shade
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
New widows howl
Strike heaven on the face
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
Like syllable of dolour.
What I believe I'll wail
What you have spoke
This tyrant
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
but something
You may deserve of him through me
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
To appease an angry god.
I am not treacherous.
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
your pardon;
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
Angels are bright still
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
I have lost my hopes.
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child
Bleed
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure
thy wrongs;
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp
Be not offended:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps
Is added to her wounds: I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but
Shall have more vices than it had before
What should he be?
It is myself I mean: in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That
Will seem as pure as snow
Esteem him as a lamb
With my confineless harms.
Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
In evils to top Macbeth.
I grant him bloody
That has a name: but there's no bottom
The cistern of my lust
All continent impediments would o'erbear
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.
Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours: you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
That vulture in you
As will to greatness dedicate themselves
With this there grows
In my most ill-composed affection such
A stanchless avarice that
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
This avarice
Sticks deeper
Than summer-seeming lust
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
Of your mere own: all these are portable
But I have none: the king-becoming graces
In the division of each several crime
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
All unity on earth.
O Scotland
If such a one be fit to govern
I am as I have spoken.
Fit to govern!
No
By his own interdiction stands accursed
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast
Macduff
Wiped the black scruples
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction
Unspeak mine own detraction
The taints and blames I laid upon myself
Unknown to woman
The devil to his fellow and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself: what I am truly
Whither indeed
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'Tis hard to reconcile.
Enter a Doctor
Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth
Ay
That stay his cure: their malady convinces
The great assay of art; but at his touch--
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
They presently amend.
I thank you
Exit Doctor
What's the disease he means?
'Tis call'd the evil:
A most miraculous work in this good king;
Which often
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue
Enter ROSS
See
My countryman; but yet I know him not.
My ever-gentle cousin
I know him now. Good God
The means that makes us strangers!
Sir
Stands Scotland where it did?
Alas
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be call'd our mother
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Are made
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps
O
Too nice
What's the newest grief?
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
Each minute teems a new one.
How does my wife?
Why
And all my children?
Well too.
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?
When I came hither to transport the tidings
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers
Be't their comfort
We are coming thither: gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out.
Would I could answer
This comfort with the like! But I have words
That would be howl'd out in the desert air
What concern they?
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?
No mind that's honest
But in it shares some woe; though the main part
Pertains to you alone.
If it be mine
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever
That ever yet they heard.
Hum! I guess at it.
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner
Merciful heaven!
What
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
My children too?
Wife
That could be found.
And I must be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?
I have said.
Be comforted:
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge
He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
What
At one fell swoop?
Dispute it like a man.
I shall do so;
But I must also feel it as a man:
I cannot but remember such things were
Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart
O
And braggart with my tongue! But
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape
This tune goes manly.
Come
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
The night is long that never finds the day.
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.
Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman
I have two nights watched with you
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
Since his majesty went into the field
her rise from her bed
her
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
A great perturbation in nature
the benefit of sleep
watching! In this slumbery agitation
walking and other actual performances
time
That
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
confirm my speech.
Enter LADY MACBETH
Lo you
and
How came she by that light?
Why
continually; 'tis her command.
You see
Ay
What is it she does now? Look
It is an accustomed action with her
washing her hands: I have known her continue in
this a quarter of an hour.
Yet here's a spot.
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
her
Out
lord
fear who knows it
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him.
Do you mark that?
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
What
that
this starting.
Go to
She has spoke what she should not
that: heaven knows what she has known.
Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. Oh
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
dignity of the whole body.
Well
Pray God it be
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
those which have walked in their sleep who have died
holily in their beds.
Wash your hands
pale.--I tell you yet again
cannot come out on's grave.
Even so?
To bed
come
done cannot be undone.--To bed
Exit
Will she go now to bed?
Directly.
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God
Remove from her the means of all annoyance
My mind she has mated
I think
Good night
Exeunt
SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.
Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH
The English power is near
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.
Near Birnam wood
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
For certain
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son
Protest their first of manhood.
What does the tyrant?
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury: but
Within the belt of rule.
Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands;
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
Those he commands move only in command
Hang loose about him
Upon a dwarfish thief.
Who then shall blame
His pester'd senses to recoil and start
Itself for being there?
Well
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal
Each drop of us.
Or so much as it needs
Make we our march towards Birnam.
Exeunt
SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.
Enter MACBETH
Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
'Fear not
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
Enter a Servant
The devil damn thee black
Where got'st thou that goose look?
There is ten thousand--
Geese
Soldiers
Go prick thy face
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers
The English force
Take thy face hence.
Exit Servant
Seyton!--I am sick at heart
Will cheer me ever
I have lived long enough: my way of life
Is fall'n into the sear
And that which should accompany old age
Enter SEYTON
What is your gracious pleasure?
What news more?
All is confirm'd
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armour.
'Tis not needed yet.
I'll put it on.
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
How does your patient
Not so sick
Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?
Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.
Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
Come
Seyton
Come
The water of my land
What rhubarb
Ay
Makes us hear something.
Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane

Exeunt
SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.
Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM
Cousins
That chambers will be safe.
We doubt it nothing.
What wood is this before us?
The wood of Birnam.
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.
It shall be done.
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane
Our setting down before 't.
'Tis his main hope:
For where there is advantage to be given
Whose hearts are absent too.
Let our just censures
Attend the true event
Industrious soldiership.
The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
Towards which advance the war.
Exeunt
SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.
Enter MACBETH
Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up:
Were they not forced with those that should be ours
A cry of women within
What is that noise?
It is the cry of women
Exit
I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
The time has been
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
Direness
Cannot once start me.
Re-enter SEYTON
Wherefore was that cry?
The queen
She should have died hereafter;
There would have been a time for such a word.
To-morrow
To the last syllable of recorded time
The way to dusty death. Out
Life's but a walking shadow
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot

Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
Gracious my lord
Well
As I did stand my watch upon the hill
Liar and slave!
Let me endure your wrath
Within this three mile may you see it coming;
I say
If thou speak'st false
I pull in resolution
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
That lies like truth: 'Fear not
Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm
If this which he avouches does appear
I gin to be aweary of the sun
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow
At least we'll die with harness on our back.
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.
Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM
Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
And show like those you are. You
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do
Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath
Exeunt
SCENE VII. Another part of the field.
Alarums. Enter MACBETH
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear
Enter YOUNG SIWARD
What is thy name?
Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.
My name's Macbeth.
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.
No
Thou liest
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain
Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at
Exit
Alarums. Enter MACDUFF
That way the noise is. Tyrant
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine
I cannot strike at wretched kerns
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter
Seems bruited. Let me find him
And more I beg not.
Exit. Alarums
Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD
This way
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
The day almost itself professes yours
We have met with foes
That strike beside us.
Enter
Exeunt. Alarums
SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.
Enter MACBETH
Why should I play the Roman fool
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives
Do better upon them.
Enter MACDUFF
Turn
Of all men else I have avoided thee:
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.
I have no words:
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!
They fight
Thou losest labour:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life
Despair thy charm;
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee
Untimely ripp'd.
Accursed be that tongue that tells me so
And be these juggling fiends no more believed
That keep the word of promise to our ear
Then yield thee
We'll have thee
I will not yield
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on
Exeunt
Retreat. Flourish. Enter
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
Some must go off: and yet
Macduff is missing
Your son
He only lived but till he was a man;
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
In the unshrinking station where he fought
Then he is dead?
Ay
Must not be measured by his worth
It hath no end.
Had he his hurts before?
Ay
Why then
Had I as many sons as I have hairs
And so
He's worth more sorrow
He's worth no more
They say he parted well
And so
Re-enter MACDUFF
Hail
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
Hail
Hail
Flourish
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves
In such an honour named. What's more to do
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
Took off her life; this
That calls upon us
So
Flourish. Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO
Escalus.
My lord.
Of government the properties to unfold
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds
My strength can give you: then no more remains
For common justice
As art and practise hath enriched any
That we remember. There is our commission
Exit an Attendant
What figure of us think you he will bear?
For you must know
Elected him our absence to supply
Of our own power: what think you of it?
If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour
Look where he comes.
Enter ANGELO
Always obedient to your grace's will
Angelo
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do
Did not go forth of us
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
But to fine issues
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But
Herself the glory of a creditor
To one that can my part in him advertise;
Hold therefore
In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus
Take thy commission.
Now
Be stamp'd upon it.
No more evasion:
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you
What doth befall you here. So
To the hopeful execution do I leave you
Of your commissions.
Yet give leave
My haste may not admit it;
Nor need you
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
I'll privily away. I love the people
Through it do well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it. Once more
The heavens give safety to your purposes!
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
I thank you. Fare you well.
Exit
I shall desire you
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place:
A power I have
I am not yet instructed.
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together
Touching that point.
I'll wait upon your honour.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A Street.
Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
If the duke with the other dukes come not to
composition with the King of Hungary
the dukes fall upon the king.
Heaven grant us its peace
Hungary's!
Amen.
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate
went to sea with the Ten Commandments
one out of the table.
'Thou shalt not steal'?
Ay
Why
all the rest from their functions: they put forth
to steal. There's not a soldier of us all
the thanksgiving before meat
well that prays for peace.
I never heard any soldier dislike it.
I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
grace was said.
No? a dozen times at least.
What
In any proportion or in any language.
I think
Ay
controversy: as
wicked villain
Well
I grant; as there may between the lists and the
velvet. Thou art the list.
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
a three-piled piece
be a list of an English kersey as be piled
art piled
feelingly now?
I think thou dost; and
feeling of thy speech: I will
confession
live
I think I have done myself wrong
Yes
Behold
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--
To what
Judge.
To three thousand dolours a year.
Ay
A French crown more.
Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
art full of error; I am sound.
Nay
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.
Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
Well
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
Who's that
Marry
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
Nay
him carried away; and
three days his head to be chopped off.
But
Art thou sure of this?
I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child.
Believe me
hours since
promise-keeping.
Besides
speech we had to such a purpose.
But
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen
Thus
with the gallows and what with poverty
custom-shrunk.
Enter POMPEY
How now! what's the news with you?
Yonder man is carried to prison.
Well; what has he done?
A woman.
But what's his offence?
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
What
No
not heard of the proclamation
What proclamation
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
And what shall become of those in the city?
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too
But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulled down?
To the ground
Why
What shall become of me?
Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
clients: though you change your place
change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
have worn your eyes almost out in the service
will be considered.
What's to do here
Here comes Signior Claudio
prison; and there's Madam Juliet.
Exeunt
Enter Provost
Fellow
Bear me to prison
I do it not in evil disposition
Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven; on whom it will
On whom it will not
Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen
Why
From too much liberty
As surfeit is the father of much fast
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue
If could speak so wisely under an arrest
send for certain of my creditors: and yet
the truth
as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
offence
What but to speak of would offend again.
What
No.
Lechery?
Call it so.
Away
One word
A hundred
Is lechery so look'd after?
Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
I got possession of Julietta's bed:
You know the lady; she is fast my wife
Of outward order: this we came not to
Remaining in the coffer of her friends
Till time had made them for us. But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
With child
Unhappily
And the new deputy now for the duke--
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
A horse whereon the governor doth ride
He can command
Whether the tyranny be in his place
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
Which have
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn; and
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
thy shoulders that a milkmaid
him.
I have done so
I prithee
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation:
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
Implore her
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
I have great hope in that; for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect
When she will play with reason and discourse
I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
like
imposition
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
I thank you
Within two hours.
Come
Exeunt
SCENE III. A monastery.
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS
No
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth.
May your grace speak of it?
My holy sir
How I have ever loved the life removed
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear
Gladly
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave
For terror
Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
The baby beats the nurse
Goes all decorum.
It rested in your grace
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
Than in Lord Angelo.
I do fear
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed
Who may
To do in slander. And to behold his sway
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you;
Only
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
That his blood flows
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see
Exeunt
SCENE IV. A nunnery.
Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA
And have you nuns no farther privileges?
Are not these large enough?
Yes
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood
[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!
Who's that which calls?
It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella
You may
When you have vow'd
But in the presence of the prioress:
Then
He calls again; I pray you
Exit
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
Enter LUCIO
Hail
Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella
To her unhappy brother Claudio?
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask
I am that Isabella and his sister.
Gentle and fair
Not to be weary with you
Woe me! for what?
For that which
He hath got his friend with child.
Sir
It is true.
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
By your renouncement an immortal spirit
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth
Your brother and his lover have embraced:
As those that feed grow full
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
Is she your cousin?
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
By vain though apt affection.
She it is.
O
This is the point.
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
Bore many gentlemen
By those that know the very nerves of state
From his true-meant design. Upon his place
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
The wanton stings and motions of the sense
With profits of the mind
He--to give fear to use and liberty
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
And follows close the rigour of the statute
To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
Doth he so seek his life?
Has censured him
Already; and
A warrant for his execution.
Alas! what poor ability's in me
To do him good?
Assay the power you have.
My power? Alas
Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo
As they themselves would owe them.
I'll see what I can do.
But speedily.
I will about it straight;
No longer staying but to give the mother
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
Commend me to my brother: soon at night
I'll send him certain word of my success.
I take my leave of you.
Good sir

Their perch and not their terror.
Ay
Let us be keen
Whom I would save
Let but your honour know
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose
Err'd in this point which now you censure him
'Tis one thing to be tempted
Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice
That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant
Because we see it; but what we do not see
We tread upon
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me
Be it as your wisdom will.
Where is the provost?
Here
See that Claudio
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
Bring him his confessor
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are

If it? please your honour

good Christians ought to have.
This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the

There are pretty orders beginning

Why dost thou ask again?
Lest I might be too rash:
Under your good correction
Repented o'er his doom.
Go to; let that be mine:

I crave your honour's pardon.
What shall be done

God save your honour!
Stay a little while.
To ISABELLA
You're welcome: what's your will?
I am a woeful suitor to your honour
Well; what's your suit?
There is a vice that most I do abhor
For which I would not plead
For which I must not plead
At war 'twixt will and will not.
Well; the matter?
I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
I do beseech you
[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
Why
Mine were the very cipher of a function
O just but severe law!
I had a brother
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to him
again
Kneel down before him
You are too cold; if you should need a pin
To him
Must he needs die?
Maiden
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him
I will not do't.
But can you
Look
But might you do't
A s mine is to him?
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.
[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.
Too late? why
May call it back again. Well
As mercy does.
If he had been as you and you as he
Pray you
I would to heaven I had your potency
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge
[Aside to ISABELLA]
Ay
Your brother is a forfeit of the law
Alas
Why
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy. How would you be
But judge you as you are? O
And mercy then will breathe within your lips
Be you content
It is the law
Were he my kinsman
To-morrow! O
He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves? Good
Who is it that hath died for this offence?
There's many have committed it.
[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay
The law hath not been dead
Those many had not dared to do that evil
Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
Takes note of what is done; and
Yet show some pity.
I show it most of all when I show justice;
For then I pity those I do not know
And do him right that
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.
So you must be the first that gives this sentence
To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
To use it like a giant.
[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.
Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does
Would use his heaven for thunder;
Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle: but man
As make the angels weep; who
[Aside to ISABELLA]  O
will relent;
He's coming; I perceive 't.
[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them
Thou'rt i' the right
That in the captain's but a choleric word
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.
Why do you put these sayings upon me?
Because authority
Knock there
That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
A natural guiltiness such as is his
Against my brother's life.
[Aside]                  She speaks
Such sense
Gentle my lord
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord
How! bribe me?
Ay
[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold
As fancy values them; but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
Ere sun-rise
To nothing temporal.
Well; come to me to-morrow.
[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!
Heaven keep your honour safe!
"[Aside]	Amen:"
For I am that way going to temptation
At what hour to-morrow
Shall I attend your lordship?
At any time 'fore noon.
'Save your honour!

From thee
What's this
The tempter or the tempted
Ha!
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
That
That modesty may more betray our sense
Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough
And pitch our evils there? O
What dost thou
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good? O
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves. What
O cunning enemy
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet
Subdues me quite. Even till now

Enter
Hail to you
I am the provost. What's your will
Bound by my charity and my blest order
Here in the prison. Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes
To them accordingly.
I would do more than that
Enter JULIET
Look
And he that got it
More fit to do another such offence
Than die for this.
When must he die?
As I do think
I have provided for you: stay awhile
And you shall be conducted.
Repent you
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
I'll gladly learn.
Love you the man that wrong'd you?
Yes
So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed?
Mutually.
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
I do confess it
'Tis meet so
I do repent me
There rest.
Your partner
Grace go with you

Must die to-morrow! O injurious love
Is still a dying horror!
'Tis pity of him.

How now! who's there?
One Isabel
Teach her the way.
Exit Servant
O heavens!
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart
Of necessary fitness?
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
Come all to help him
By which he should revive: and even so
The general
Crowd to his presence
Must needs appear offence.
Enter ISABELLA
How now
I am come to know your pleasure.
That you might know it
Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
Yet may he live awhile; and
Under your sentence?
Yea.
When
That his soul sicken not.
Ha! fie
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
A man already made
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one.
'Tis set down so in heaven
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
Which had you rather
Now took your brother's life; or
As she that he hath stain'd?
Sir
I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
Stand more for number than for accompt.
How say you?
Nay
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
I
Might there not be a charity in sin
To save this brother's life?
Please you to do't
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul
That I do beg his life
To have it added to the faults of mine
Nay
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant
Let me be ignorant
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
Than beauty could
To be received plain
Your brother is to die.
So.
And his offence is so
True.
Admit no other way to save his life
As I subscribe not that
Of the all-building law; and that there were
No earthly mean to save him
You must lay down the treasures of your body
To this supposed
What would you do?
As much for my poor brother as myself:
That is
That longing have been sick for
My body up to shame.
Then must your brother die.
And 'twere the cheaper way:
Better it were a brother died at once
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
That you have slander'd so?
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses: lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
And rather proved the sliding of your brother
A merriment than a vice.
O
I something do excuse the thing I hate
We are all frail.
Else let my brother die
Owe and succeed thy weakness.
Nay
Ay
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
In profiting by them. Nay
For we are soft as our complexions are
I think it well:
And from this testimony of your own sex
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames
I do arrest your words. Be that you are
If you be one
By all external warrants
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord
Plainly conceive
My brother did love Juliet
He shall not
I know your virtue hath a licence in't
Believe me
Ha! little honour to be much believed
I will proclaim thee
Sign me a present pardon for my brother
What man thou art.
Who will believe thee
My unsoil'd name
And smell of calumny. I have begun
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
By yielding up thy body to my will;
Or else he must not only die the death
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow
Exit
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood
That
On twenty bloody blocks
To such abhorr'd pollution.
Then
More than our brother is our chastity.
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the prison.
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope:
I've hope to live
Be absolute for death; either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
If I do lose thee
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep
Thy death
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
For what thou hast not
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects
For
For thine own bowels
Becomes as aged
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear
I humbly thank you.
To sue to live
And

Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
Dear sir
Most holy sir
Enter ISABELLA

And very welcome. Look

As many as you please.
Bring me to hear them speak
Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost
Now
Why
Lord Angelo
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
To-morrow you set on.
Is there no remedy?
None
But is there any?
Yes
There is a devilish mercy in the judge
Perpetual durance?
Ay
But in what nature?
In such a one as
Let me know the point.
O
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
The sense of death is most in apprehension;
And the poor beetle
As when a giant dies.
Why give you me this shame?
Think you I can a resolution fetch
From flowery tenderness? If I must die
There spake my brother; there my father's grave
Did utter forth a voice. Yes
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
As falcon doth the fowl
His filth within being cast
A pond as deep as hell.
The prenzie Angelo!
O
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think
If I would yield him my virginity
O heavens! it cannot be.
Yes
That I should do what I abhor to name
Thou shalt not do't.
O
As frankly as a pin.
Thanks
Be ready
Yes. Has he affections in him
Which is the least?
If it were damnable
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
What says my brother?
Death is a fearful thing.
And shamed life a hateful.
Ay
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death.
Alas
Sweet sister
What sin you do to save a brother's life
That it becomes a virtue.
O you beast!
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
Is't not a kind of incest
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
Die
Reprieve thee from thy fate
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death
Nay
O
Thy sin's not accidental
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
'Tis best thou diest quickly.
O hear me
Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO
Vouchsafe a word
What is your will?
Might you dispense with your leisure
by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
would require is likewise your own benefit.
I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.
Walks apart
Son
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures: she
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
your knees and make ready.
Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
Hold you there: farewell.
Exit CLAUDIO
Provost
Re-enter Provost
What's your will
That now you are come
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.
In good time.
Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; but grace
your complexion
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you
that frailty hath examples for his falling
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substitute
I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born. But
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
speak to him
discover his government.
That shall not be much amiss: Yet
now stands
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; and much please the absent duke
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business.
Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
Virtue is bold
you not heard speak of Mariana

I have heard of the lady
She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
to her by oath
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity

poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned brother
kind and natural; with him

Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
Left her in her tears
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole
wears for his sake; and he
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world! What corruption in this life
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
cure of it not only saves your brother
you from dishonour in doing it.
Show me how
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness
in all reason should have quenched her love
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
this advantage
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course
all
your appointment
acknowledge itself hereafter
her recompense: and here
saved
advantaged
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
think well to carry this as you may
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think you of it?
The image of it gives me content already; and I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
bed

it may be quickly.
I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well

What news
I know none. Can you tell me of any?
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
some
I know not where; but wheresoever
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
puts transgression to 't.
He does well in 't.
A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
him: something too crabbed that way
It is too general a vice
Yes
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
it quite
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
woman after this downright way of creation: is it
TRUE
How should he be made
Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
motion generative; that's infallible.
You are pleasant
Why
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
knew the service
I never heard the absent duke much detected for
women; he was not inclined that way.
O
'Tis not possible.
Who
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
that let me inform you.
You do him wrong
Sir
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
withdrawing.
What
No
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
understand
duke to be wise.
Wise! why

Either this is the envy in you
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
bringings-forth

Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.
Sir
Love talks with better knowledge

you speak. But

answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke
upon you; and
Sir
He shall know you better

can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me

Why should he die
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
the duke we talk of were returned again: the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency; sparrows must not build in his
house-eaves

novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous

prepared. I am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation.
He professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
to himself
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him
resolved to die.
You have paid the heavens your function
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest

What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon?
A Bohemian born
that is a prisoner nine years old.

delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and

It is now apparent?
Most manifest
Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
seems he to be touched?
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep; careless
of what's past
mortality
He wants advice.
He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence
would not: drunk many times a day
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him
to carry him to execution
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.

This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but
is writ. Look
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
things should be: all difficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call your executioner

Go in to him
He is coming
Is the axe upon the block
Very ready
Enter BARNARDINE
How now
Truly
prayers; for
You rogue
fitted for 't.
O
sounder all the next day.
Look you
we jest now
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
Sir
you are to depart
you and pray with you.
Friar
shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
consent to die this day
O
Look forward on the journey you shall go.
I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
persuasion.
But hear you.
Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me
Exit
Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
After him
Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY
Re-enter Provost
Now
A creature unprepared
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable.
Here in the prison
One Ragozine
Just of his colour. What if we do omit
This reprobate till he were well inclined;
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine
O
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
This shall be done
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
And how shall we continue Claudio
If he were known alive?
Let this be done.
Put them in secret holds
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation
Your safety manifested.
I am your free dependant.
Quick
Exit Provost
Now will I write letters to Angelo
The provost
Shall witness to him I am near at home
To enter publicly: him I'll desire
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city; and from thence
Re-enter Provost
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours.
I'll make all speed.
Exit
[Within]  Peace
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
But I will keep her ignorant of her good
Enter ISABELLA
Ho
Good morning to you
The better
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
He hath released him
His head is off and sent to Angelo.
Nay
It is no other: show your wisdom
O
You shall not be admitted to his sight.
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
Mark what I say
By every syllable a faithful verity:
The duke comes home to-morrow; nay
One of our convent
Notice to Escalus and Angelo
In that good path that I would wish it go
I am directed by you.
This letter
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
Say
At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
I'll perfect him withal
Before the duke
Accuse him home and home. For my poor self
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart; trust not my holy order
Enter LUCIO
Good even. Friar
Not within
O pretty Isabella
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my troth
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home
Exit ISABELLA
Sir
reports; but the best is
Friar
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
Well
Nay
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
You have told me too many of him already
they be true; if not true
I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
Did you such a thing?
Yes
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
Sir
By my troth
if bawdy talk offend you
it. Nay
Exeunt
SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.
Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
not tainted! And why meet him at the gates
redeliver our authorities there
I guess not.
And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering
He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
complaints
hereafter
against us.
Well
i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him.
I shall
Good night.
Exit ESCALUS
This deed unshapes me quite
And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
And by an eminent body that enforced
The law against it! But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss
For my authority bears of a credent bulk
But it confounds the breather. He should have lived
With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
A lack
Exit
SCENE V. Fields without the town.
Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit
These letters at fit time deliver me
Giving letters
The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
To Valentinus
But send me Flavius first.
It shall be speeded well.
Exit
Enter VARRIUS
I thank thee
Come
Will greet us here anon
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.
Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA
To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so
He says
Be ruled by him.
Besides
He speak against me on the adverse side
That's bitter to sweet end.
I would Friar Peter--
O
Enter FRIAR PETER
Come
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates
The duke is entering: therefore
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. The city gate.
MARIANA veiled
My very worthy cousin
Our old and faithful friend
Happy return be to your royal grace!
Many and hearty thankings to you both.
We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
Such goodness of your justice
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
You make my bonds still greater.
O
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within. Come
And good supporters are you.
FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.
Justice
Upon a wrong'd
O worthy prince
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
Reveal yourself to him.
O worthy duke
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
Must either punish me
My lord
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
Cut off by course of justice
By course of justice!
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
Most strange
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
That Angelo is an adulterous thief
Is it not strange and strange?
Nay
It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange:
Nay
To the end of reckoning.
Away with her! Poor soul
O prince
There is another comfort than this world
That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
But one
As Angelo; even so may Angelo
If he be less
By mine honesty
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
O gracious duke
For inequality; but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid
Many that are not mad
Have
I am the sister of one Claudio
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
I
As then the messenger
That's I
I came to her from Claudio
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
For her poor brother's pardon.
That's he indeed.
You were not bid to speak.
No
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
I wish you now
Pray you
A business for yourself
Be perfect.
I warrant your honour.
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale
Right.
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
To speak before your time. Proceed.
I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy
That's somewhat madly spoken.
Pardon it;
The phrase is to the matter.
Mended again. The matter; proceed.
In brief
For this was of much length
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
He would not
To his concupiscible intemperate lust
For my poor brother's head.
This is most likely!
O
By heaven
In hateful practise. First
Stands without blemish. Next
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
Confess the truth
Thou camest here to complain.
And is this all?
Then
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe
I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
One that I would were here
A ghostly father
My lord
I do not like the man: had he been lay
For certain words he spake against your grace
In your retirement
Words against me? this is a good friar
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
But yesternight
Blessed be your royal grace!
I have stood by
Your royal ear abused. First
Most wrongfully accused your substitute
As she from one ungot.
We did believe no less.
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
I know him for a man divine and holy;
Not scurvy
And
Did
My lord
Well
But at this instant he is sick my lord
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo
Is true and false; and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear
To justify this worthy nobleman
Good friar
ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward
Do you not smile at this
O heaven
Give us some seats. Come
In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
Of your own cause. Is this the witness
First
Pardon
Until my husband bid me.
What
No
Are you a maid?
No
A widow
Neither
Why
My lord
neither maid
Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself.
Well
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
And I confess besides I am no maid:
I have known my husband; yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me.
He was drunk then
For the benefit of silence
Well
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
Now I come to't my lord
She that accuses him of fornication
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
With all the effect of love.
Charges she more than me?
Not that I know.
No? you say your husband.
Why
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
Unveiling
This is that face
This is the hand which
That took away the match from Isabel
In her imagined person.
Know you this woman?
Carnally
Sirrah
Enough
My lord
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off
Came short of composition
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity: since which time of five years
I never spake with her
Noble prince
As words could make up vows: and
He knew me as a wife. As this is true
Or else for ever be confixed here
I did but smile till now:
Now
My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on: let me have way
Ay
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
Thou foolish friar
That's seal'd in approbation? You
To find out this abuse
There is another friar that set them on;
Let him be sent for.
Would he were here
Hath set the women on to this complaint:
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him.
Go do it instantly.
Exit Provost
And you
But stir not you till you have well determined
Upon these slanderers.
My lord
Exit DUKE
Signior Lucio
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke.
We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
notable fellow.
As any in Vienna
Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
Exit an Attendant
Pray you
shall see how I'll handle her.
Not better than he
Say you?
Marry
I will go darkly to work with her.
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit
Come on
that you have said.
My lord
the provost.
In very good time: speak not you to him till we
call upon you.
Mum.
Come
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
'Tis false.
How! know you where you are?
Respect to your great place! and let the devil
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
Look you speak justly.
Boldly
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust
Which here you come to accuse.
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
Why
To accuse this worthy man
And in the witness of his proper ear
To the duke himself
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
Joint by joint
What 'unjust'!
Be not so hot; the duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not
Made me a looker on here in Vienna
Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
What can you vouch against him
Is this the man that you did tell us of?
'Tis he
do you know me?
I remember you
met you at the prison
O
Most notedly
Do you so
fool
You must
that my report: you
much more
O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches?
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
Hark
treasonable abuses!
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too
with the other confederate companion!
[To Provost]  Stay
What
Come
bald-pated
you? Show your knave's visage
show your sheep-biting face
Will't not off?
Pulls off the friar's hood
Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
First
To LUCIO
Sneak not away
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
This may prove worse than hanging.
[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
We'll borrow place of him.
To ANGELO
Sir
Hast thou or word
O my dread lord
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg.
Come hither
Say
I was
Go take her hence
Do you the office
Exeunt ANGELO
My lord
Than at the strangeness of it.
Come hither
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
Advertising and holy to your business
Attorney'd at your service.
O
Your unknown sovereignty!
You are pardon'd
And now
Your brother's death
And you may marvel why I obscured myself
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid
That life is better life
I do
Re-enter ANGELO
For this new-married man approaching here
Your well defended honour
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother
Being criminal
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
Thereon dependent
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible
Haste still pays haste
Like doth quit like
Then
Which
We do condemn thee to the very block
Where Claudio stoop'd to death
Away with him!
O my most gracious lord
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour
And choke your good to come; for his possessions
O my dear lord
Never crave him; we are definitive.
Gentle my liege
Kneeling
You do but lose your labour.
Away with him to death!
To LUCIO
Now
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel
Lend me your knees
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
Against all sense you do importune her:
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
Isabel
Hold up your hands
They say
And
For being a little bad: so may my husband.
O Isabel
He dies for Claudio's death.
Most bounteous sir
Look
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
For Angelo
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
Intents but merely thoughts.
Merely
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up
I have bethought me of another fault.
Provost
At an unusual hour?
It was commanded so.
Had you a special warrant for the deed?
No
For which I do discharge you of your office:
Give up your keys.
Pardon me
I thought it was a fault
Yet did repent me
For testimony whereof
What's he?
His name is Barnardine.
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
Exit Provost
I am sorry
As you
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
'Tis my deserving
Re-enter Provost
Which is that Barnardine?
This
There was a friar told me of this man.
Sirrah
That apprehends no further than this world
But
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come. Friar
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?
This is another prisoner that I saved.
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
As like almost to Claudio as himself.
Unmuffles CLAUDIO
[To ISABELLA]  If he be like your brother
Is he pardon'd; and
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
Well
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
I find an apt remission in myself;
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
To LUCIO
You
Wherein have I so deserved of you
'Faith
trick. If you will hang me for it
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.
Whipt first
Proclaim it
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow
Whom he begot with child
I beseech your highness
Your highness said even now
good my lord
Upon mine honour
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
And see our pleasure herein executed.
Marrying a punk
Slandering a prince deserves it.
Exit Officers with LUCIO
She
Joy to you
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
Thanks
There's more behind that is more gratulate.
Thanks
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
Forgive him
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline
So
What's yet behind
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. Venice. A street.
Enter ANTONIO
In sooth
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
But how I caught it
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
There
Believe me
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
Plucking the grass
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures
Would make me sad.
My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone
To think on this
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
Believe me
Upon the fortune of this present year:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
Why
Fie
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
Enter BASSANIO
Here comes Bassanio
We leave you now with better company.
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry
Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it
And you embrace the occasion to depart.
Good morrow
Good signiors both
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
Exeunt Salarino and Salanio
My Lord Bassanio
I will not fail you.
You look not well
You have too much respect upon the world:
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Believe me
I hold the world but as the world
A stage where every man must play a part
Let me play the fool:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish? I tell thee what
I love thee
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond
Of wisdom
O my Antonio
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing; when
I'll tell thee more of this another time:
But fish not
Come
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
Well
I must be one of these same dumb wise men
Well
Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
Thanks
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO
Is that any thing now?
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find them
have them
Well
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
'Tis not unknown to you
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged. To you
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
I pray you
And if it stand
In my school-days
The self-same way with more advised watch
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof
I owe you much
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
You know me well
To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done
In Belmont is a lady richly left;
And she is fair
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia
To Cato's daughter
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
Renowned suitors
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand
O my Antonio
To hold a rival place with one of them
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack'd
Go
To have it of my trust or for my sake.
Exeunt
SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
By my troth
this great world.
You would be
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
yet
with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
is no mean happiness therefore
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs
competency lives longer.
Good sentences and well pronounced.
They would be better
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do
cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
devise laws for the blood
o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
youth
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband. O me
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard
Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery
chooses you
rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come?
I pray thee
them

First
Ay
talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts
shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith.
Then there is the County Palatine.
He doth nothing but frown
will not have me
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these. God defend me from these
two!
How say you by the French lord
God made him
In truth
Neapolitan's
the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
throstle sing
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him
should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
I would forgive him
shall never requite him.
What say you
of England?
You know I say nothing to him
not me
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
He is a proper man's picture
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
I think he bought his doublet in Italy
hose in France
behavior every where.
What think you of the Scottish lord
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another.
How like you the young German
Very vilely in the morning
most vilely in the afternoon
he is best
when he is worst
and the worst fall that ever fell
make shift to go without him.
If he should offer to choose
casket

Therefore
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket

You need not fear

determinations; which is
home and to trouble you with no more suit
you may be won by some other sort than your father's
imposition depending on the caskets.
If I live to be as old as Sibylla
chaste as Diana
of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable
but I dote on his very absence
them a fair departure.
Do you not remember
Venetian

Yes
TRUE
eyes looked upon
I remember him well
thy praise.
Enter a Serving-man
How now! what news?
The four strangers seek for you
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth
prince his master will be here to-night.
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as I can bid the other four farewell
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil
rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come
Whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer
Exeunt
SCENE III. Venice. A public place.
Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK
Three thousand ducats; well.
Ay
For three months; well.
For the which
Antonio shall become bound; well.
May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
know your answer?
Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
Your answer to that.
Antonio is a good man.
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
Oh
good man is to have you understand me that he is
sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis
Indies; I understand moreover
hath a third at Mexico
other ventures he hath
are but boards
and water-rats
mean pirates
take his bond.
Be assured you may.
I will be assured I may; and
If it please you to dine with us.
Yes
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
will buy with you
with you
news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
Enter ANTONIO
This is Signior Antonio.
[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip
He hates our sacred nation
Shylock
I am debating of my present store
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Tubal
Do you desire?
To ANTONIO
Rest you fair
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
Shylock
By taking nor by giving of excess
How much ye would?
Ay
And for three months.
I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
Well then
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.
I do never use it.
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
This Jacob from our holy Abram was
And what of him? did he take interest?
No
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire
Between these woolly breeders in the act
Fall parti-colour'd lambs
This was a way to thrive
And thrift is blessing
This was a venture
A thing not in his power to bring to pass
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me
Mark you this
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek
O
Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then
Well
Signior Antonio
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug
You call me misbeliever
Well then
Go to
'Shylock
You
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
What should I say to you? Should I not say
'Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key
'Fair sir
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
I am as like to call thee so again
If thou wilt lend this money
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
But lend it rather to thine enemy
Exact the penalty.
Why
I would be friends with you and have your love
Of usance for my moneys
This is kind I offer.
This were kindness.
This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary
Your single bond; and
Express'd in the condition
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh
In what part of your body pleaseth me.
Content
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
Why
Within these two months
This bond expires
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
O father Abram
The thoughts of others! Pray you
If he should break his day
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable
If he will take it
And
Yes Shylock
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond
Of an unthrifty knave
I will be with you.
Hie thee
Exit Shylock
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
My ships come home a month before the day.

SCENE I. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO  and his train; PORTIA
Mislike me not for my complexion
Bring me the fairest creature northward born
I tell thee
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
The best-regarded virgins of our clime
Have loved it too: I would not change this hue
In terms of choice I am not solely led
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
Besides
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
But if my father had not scanted me
And hedged me by his wit
His wife who wins me by that means I told you
As any comer I have look'd on yet
For my affection.
Even for that I thank you:
Therefore
To try my fortune. By this scimitar
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
So is Alcides beaten by his page;
And so may I
You must take your chance
Or swear before you choose
Never to speak to lady afterward
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
Nor will not. Come
First
Your hazard shall be made.
Good fortune then!
To make me blest or cursed'st among men.

your worship
In very brief
your worship shall know by this honest old man; and
One speak for both. What would you?
Serve you
That is the very defect of the matter
I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day
To leave a rich Jew's service
The follower of so poor a gentleman.
The old proverb is very well parted between my
master Shylock and you

Thou speak'st it well. Go
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
My lodging out. Give him a livery
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.

Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear

Signior Bassanio!
Gratiano!
I have a suit to you.
You have obtain'd it.
You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
Why then you must. But hear thee
Thou art too wild
Parts that become thee happily enough
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
But where thou art not known
Something too liberal. Pray thee
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit
I be misconstrued in the place I go to
Signior Bassanio
If I do not put on a sober habit
Thus with my hat
Use all the observance of civility
To please his grandam
Well
Nay
By what we do to-night.
No
I would entreat you rather to put on
Your boldest suit of mirth
That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
I have some business.
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
But we will visit you at supper-time.

I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
Our house is hell
But fare thee well

And so farewell: I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee.
Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful

At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
'Tis good we do so.

There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?

SCENE VI. The same.
Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO
This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
Desired us to make stand.
His hour is almost past.
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour
O
To seal love's bonds new-made
To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down?
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first? All things that are
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay
How like the prodigal doth she return
Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.

When you shall please to play the thieves for wives
Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?

Who are you? Tell me

The pretty follies that themselves commit;
For if they could
To see me thus transformed to a boy.

Why
And I should be obscured.
So are you
But come at once;
For the close night doth play the runaway
I will make fast the doors
With some more ducats

Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
For she is wise

Who's there?
Signior Antonio!
Fie
'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
Bassanio presently will go aboard:
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
Than to be under sail and gone to-night.
Exeunt
SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA
Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The several caskets to this noble prince.
Now make your choice.
The first
The second
This third
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
The one of them contains my picture
If you choose that
Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
I will survey the inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages:
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
As much as he deserves! Pause there
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation
May not extend so far as to the lady:
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
Were but a weak disabling of myself.
As much as I deserve! Why
I do in birth deserve her
But more than these
What if I stray'd no further
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Why
From the four corners of the earth they come
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia:
The watery kingdom
Spits in the face of heaven
To stop the foreign spirits
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
To think so base a thought: it were too gross
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think in silver she's immured
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
Stamped in gold
But here an angel in a golden bed
Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
Here do I choose
There
He unlocks the golden casket
O hell! what have we here?
A carrion Death
There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
Reads
All that glitters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told:
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold:
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
Had you been as wise as bold
Fare you well; your suit is cold.
Cold
Then
Portia
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets
A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains
Let all of his complexion choose me so.
Exeunt
SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.
Enter SALARINO and SALANIO
Why
With him is Gratiano gone along;
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke
He came too late
But there the duke was given to understand
That in a gondola were seen together
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
Besides
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
I never heard a passion so confused
'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
Justice! the law! my ducats
A sealed bag
And jewels
She hath the stones upon her
Why
Let good Antonio look he keep his day
Marry
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday
The French and English
A vessel of our country richly fraught:
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
Yet do not suddenly
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
Of his return: he answer'd
Slubber not business for my sake
But stay the very riping of the time;
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me
Be merry
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
As shall conveniently become you there:'
And even there
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
I think he only loves the world for him.
I pray thee
And quicken his embraced heaviness
With some delight or other.
Do we so.

Enter NERISSA with a Servitor
Quick
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath
Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON
Behold
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd
But if you fail
I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
First
Which casket 'twas I chose; next
Of the right casket
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly
To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
You shall look fairer
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
By the fool multitude
Which pries not to the interior
I will not choose what many men desire
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
Why
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
And well said too; for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.
O
Were not derived corruptly
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be new-varnish'd! Well
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this
He opens the silver casket
Too long a pause for that which you find there.
What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot
How much unlike art thou to Portia!
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
To offend
And of opposed natures.
What is here?
Reads
The fire seven times tried this:
Seven times tried that judgment is
Some there be that shadows kiss;
Such have but a shadow's bliss:
There be fools alive
Take what wife you will to bed
So be gone: you are sped.
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here
With one fool's head I came to woo

Where is my lady?
Here: what would my lord?

To signify the approaching of his lord;
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets

I would it might prove the end of his losses.
Let me say 'amen' betimes

Enter SHYLOCK
How now
You know
daughter's flight.
That's certain: I
that made the wings she flew withal.
And Shylock
fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam.
She is damned for it.
That's certain
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
Out upon it
I say
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
tell us
loss at sea or no?
There I have another bad match: a bankrupt
prodigal
Rialto; a beggar
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
look to his bond.
Why
his flesh: what's that good for?
To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else
hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses
bargains
enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands
the same food
to the same diseases
a Christian is? If you prick us
if you tickle us

resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian
wrong a Jew

Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be

Exeunt SALANIO
How now
found my daughter?
I often came where I did hear of her
Why
never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
precious
were dead at my foot
would she were hearsed at my foot
her coffin! No news of them? Why
not what's spent in the search: why
loss! the thief gone with so much
find the thief; and no satisfaction
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
but of my shedding.
Yes
heard in Genoa
What
Hath an argosy cast away
I thank God
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
I thank thee
ha
Your daughter spent in Genoa
night fourscore ducats.
Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
fourscore ducats!
There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
company to Venice
I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
him: I am glad of it.
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
daughter for a monkey.
Out upon her! Thou torturest me
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
But Antonio is certainly undone.
Nay

will have the heart of him
he out of Venice
will. Go

SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
Enter BASSANIO
I pray you
Before you hazard; for
There's something tells me
But lest you should not understand me well
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me. I could teach you
How to choose right
So will I never be: so may you miss me;
But if you do
One half of me is yours
Put bars between the owners and their rights!
And so
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time
Let me choose
For as I am
Upon the rack
What treason there is mingled with your love.
None but that ugly treason of mistrust
There may as well be amity and life
'Tween snow and fire
Ay
Promise me life
Well then
'Confess' and 'love'
Had been the very sum of my confession:
O happy torment
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
Away
If you do love me
Nerissa and the rest
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
Then
May stand more proper
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
And what is music then? Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives
The issue of the exploit. Go
Live thou
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
Music
SONG.
Tell me where is fancy bred
How begot
Reply
It is engender'd in the eyes
In the cradle where it lies.
Let us all ring fancy's knell
I'll begin it
Ding
So may the outward shows be least themselves:
The world is still deceived with ornament.
In law
Will bless it and approve it with a text
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
How many cowards
As stairs of sand
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
Who
And these assume but valour's excrement
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty
Which therein works a miracle in nature
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind
To be the dowry of a second head
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word
To entrap the wisest. Therefore
Nor none of thee
'Tween man and man: but thou
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!
[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less
What find I here?
Opening the leaden casket
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
Or whether
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men
How could he see to do them? having made one
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll
Reads
You that choose not by the view
Since this fortune falls to you
And hold your fortune for your bliss
And claim her with a loving kiss.
A gentle scroll. Fair lady
I come by note
Like one of two contending in a prize
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
So
As doubtful whether what I see be true
You see me
I would not be ambitious in my wish
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair
That only to stand high in your account
Is sum of something
Happy in this
But she may learn; happier than this
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion
Are yours
Which when you part from
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
Madam
And there is such confusion in my powers
By a beloved prince
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
Where every something
Parts from this finger
O
My lord and lady
My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady
For I am sure you can wish none from me:
And when your honours mean to solemnize
The bargain of your faith
With all my heart
I thank your lordship
My eyes
You saw the mistress
You loved
No more pertains to me
Your fortune stood upon the casket there
For wooing here until I sweat again
With oaths of love
To have her love
Achieved her mistress.
Is this true
Madam
And do you
Yes
Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
What
No; we shall ne'er win at that sport
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What
Enter LORENZO
Lorenzo and Salerio
If that the youth of my new interest here
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave
So do I
They are entirely welcome.
I thank your honour. For my part
But meeting with Salerio by the way
I did
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
Commends him to you.
Gives Bassanio a letter
Ere I ope his letter
Not sick
Nor well
Will show you his estate.
Nerissa
Your hand
How doth that royal merchant
I know he will be glad of our success;
We are the Jasons
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man. What
With leave
That this same paper brings you.
O sweet Portia
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady
Ran in my veins
And then I told you true: and yet
How much I was a braggart. When I told you
My state was nothing
That I was worse than nothing; for
The paper as the body of my friend
Have all his ventures fail'd? What
From Tripolis
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?
Not one
Besides
The present money to discharge the Jew
A creature
He plies the duke at morning and at night
Of greatest port
But none can drive him from the envious plea
Of forfeiture
When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him: and I know
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
The dearest friend to me
In doing courtesies
The ancient Roman honour more appears
Than any that draws breath in Italy.
What sum owes he the Jew?
For me three thousand ducats.
What
Pay him six thousand
Double six thousand
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
When it is paid
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows. Come
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Bid your friends welcome
Since you are dear bought
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio
miscarried
very low
in paying it
debts are cleared between you and I
see you at my death. Notwithstanding
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come
O love
Since I have your good leave to go away
Exeunt
SCENE III. Venice. A street.
Enter SHYLOCK
Gaoler
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
Gaoler
Hear me yet
I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
But
The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder
To come abroad with him at his request.
I pray thee
I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool
To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
Exit
It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men.
Let him alone:
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
Many that have at times made moan to me;
Therefore he hates me.
I am sure the duke
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
The duke cannot deny the course of law:
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore
These griefs and losses have so bated me
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
Well
To see me pay his debt
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
Enter PORTIA
Madam
Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
But if you  knew to whom you show this honour
Than customary bounty can enforce you.
I never did repent for doing good
That do converse and waste the time together
Of lineaments
Which makes me think that this Antonio
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish misery!
This comes too near the praising of myself;
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
Lorenzo
The husbandry and manage of my house
Until my lord's return: for mine own part
To live in prayer and contemplation
There is a monastery two miles off;
And there will we abide. I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition;
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you.
Madam
I shall obey you in all fair commands.
My people do already know my mind
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
And so farewell
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
I thank you for your wish
To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO
Now
In speed to Padua: see thou render this
Into my cousin's hand
And
Unto the tranect
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words
Madam
Exit
Come on
That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
Before they think of us.
Shall they see us?
They shall
With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager
With a reed voice
Into a manly stride
Like a fine bragging youth
I could not do withal; then I'll repent
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks
Why
Fie
But come
When I am in my coach
At the park gate; and therefore haste away
Exeunt
SCENE V. The same. A garden.
Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA
Yes
are to be laid upon the children: therefore
promise ye
you
therefore be of good cheer
are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
hope neither.
And what hope is that
Marry
not
That were a kind of bastard hope
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
mother: thus when I shun Scylla
fall into Charybdis
gone both ways.
I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
Christian.
Truly
enow before; e'en as many as could well live
another. This making Christians will raise the
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
Enter LORENZO
I'll tell my husband
I shall grow jealous of you shortly
you thus get my wife into corners.
Nay
are out. He tells me flatly
me in heaven
says
price of pork.
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
Moor is with child by you
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
but if she be less than an honest woman
indeed more than I took her for.
How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence
parrots. Go in
That is done
Goodly Lord
them prepare dinner.
That is done too
Will you cover then
Not so
Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
tree
go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table
in the meat
For the table
meat
to dinner
conceits shall govern.
Exit
O dear discretion
The fool hath planted in his memory
An army of good words; and I do know
A many fools
Defy the matter. How cheerest thou
And now
Past all expressing. It is very meet
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
For
And if on earth he do not mean it
In reason he should never come to heaven
Why
And on the wager lay two earthly women
Pawn'd with the other
Hath not her fellow.
Even such a husband
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
Nay
I will anon: first
Nay
No
"'	Then"
I shall digest it.
Well
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.
Enter the DUKE
What
Ready
I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
A stony adversary
uncapable of pity
From any dram of mercy.
I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach
My patience to his fury
To suffer
Go one
He is ready at the door: he comes
Enter SHYLOCK
Make room
Shylock
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer
I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
But
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned? What
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some
And others
Of what it likes or loathes. Now
As there is no firm reason to be render'd
Why he
Why he
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend
So can I give no reason
I bear Antonio
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
This is no answer
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
Do all men kill the things they do not love?
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
Every offence is not a hate at first.
What
I pray you
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise
You may as well do anything most hard
His Jewish heart: therefore
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
What judgment shall I dread
Were in six parts and every part a ducat
How shalt thou hope for mercy
What judgment shall I dread
You have among you many a purchased slave
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
The pound of flesh
If you deny me
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
Upon my power I may dismiss this court
My lord
A messenger with letters from the doctor
Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
Good cheer
The Jew shall have my flesh
I am a tainted wether of the flock
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
You cannot better be employ'd
Enter NERISSA
Came you from Padua
From both
Presenting a letter
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
Not on thy sole
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
No
O
And for thy life let justice be accused.
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
Govern'd a wolf
Are wolvish
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
Repair thy wit
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court.
Where is he?
He attendeth here hard by
With all my heart. Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
[Reads]
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
your messenger came
me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
many books together: he is furnished with my
opinion; which
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend
with him
request in my stead. I beseech you
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
old a head. I leave him to your gracious
acceptance
commendation.
You hear the learn'd Bellario
And here
Enter PORTIA
Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
I did
You are welcome: take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court?
I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here
Antonio and old Shylock
Is your name Shylock?
Shylock is my name.
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger
Ay
Do you confess the bond?
I do.
Then must the Jew be merciful.
On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
The quality of mercy is not strain'd
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
My deeds upon my head! I crave the law
Is he not able to discharge the money?
Yes
Yea
If this will not suffice
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you
To do a great right
It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
A Daniel come to judgment! yea
O wise young judge
I pray you
Here 'tis
Shylock
An oath
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No
Why
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.
Why then
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
O noble judge! O excellent young man!
For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty
'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
Therefore lay bare your bosom.
Ay
So says the bond: doth it not
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh?
I have them ready.
Have by some surgeon
Is it so nominated in the bond?
It is not so express'd: but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
You
But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
Give me your hand
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you
And
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough
Antonio
Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself
I would lose all
Here to this devil
Your wife would give you little thanks for that
I have a wife
I would she were in heaven
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet house.
These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
Aside
We trifle time: I pray thee
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The court awards it
Most rightful judge!
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it
Most learned judge! A sentence! Come
Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Take then thy bond
But
One drop of Christian blood
Are
Unto the state of Venice.
O upright judge! Mark
Is that the law?
Thyself shalt see the act:
For
Thou shalt have justice
O learned judge! Mark
I take this offer
And let the Christian go.
Here is the money.
Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
O Jew! an upright judge
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
Or less than a just pound
As makes it light or heavy in the substance
Of one poor scruple
But in the estimation of a hair
A second Daniel
Now
Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
Give me my principal
I have it ready for thee; here it is.
He hath refused it in the open court:
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
A Daniel
I thank thee
Shall I not have barely my principal?
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
Why
I'll stay no longer question.
Tarry
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only
In which predicament
For it appears
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
And yet
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits
For half thy wealth
The other half comes to the general state
Ay
Nay
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live.
What mercy can you render him
A halter gratis; nothing else
So please my lord the duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods
The other half in use
That lately stole his daughter:
Two things provided more
The other
He shall do this
The pardon that I late pronounced here.
Art thou contented
I am content.
Clerk
I pray you
I am not well: send the deed after me
Get thee gone
In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
Had I been judge
Exit SHYLOCK
Sir
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
I must away this night toward Padua
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio
Exeunt Duke and his train
Most worthy gentleman
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof
And stand indebted
He is well paid that is well satisfied;
And I
And therein do account myself well paid:
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you
I wish you well
Dear sir
Take some remembrance of us
You press me far
To ANTONIO
Give me your gloves
To BASSANIO
And
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
And you in love shall not deny me this.
This ring
I will not shame myself to give you this.
I will have nothing else but only this;
And now methinks I have a mind to it.
There's more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you
Only for this
I see
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
Good sir
And when she put it on
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
An if your wife be not a mad-woman
Exeunt Portia and Nerissa
My Lord Bassanio
Let his deservings and my love withal
Be valued against your wife's commandment.
Go
Give him the ring
Exit Gratiano
Come
And in the morning early will we both
Fly toward Belmont: come
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same. A street.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
Inquire the Jew's house out
And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
And be a day before our husbands home:
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
Enter GRATIANO
Fair sir
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring
Your company at dinner.
That cannot be:
His ring I do accept most thankfully:
And so
That will I do.
Sir
Aside to PORTIA
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring
[Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst
We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;
But we'll outface them
Aloud
Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.
Come
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.
Enter LORENZO and JESSICA
The moon shines bright: in such a night as this
And they did make no noise
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents
In such a night
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
And ran dismay'd away.
In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
To come again to Carthage.
In such a night
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
That did renew old AEson.
In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont.
In such a night
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well
And ne'er a true one.
In such a night
Did pretty Jessica
I would out-night you
But
Enter STEPHANO
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
A friend.
A friend! what friend? your name
Stephano is my name; and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
By holy crosses
For happy wedlock hours.
Who comes with her?
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you
He is not
But go we in
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
Enter LAUNCELOT
Sola
Who calls?
Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
Master Lorenzo
Leave hollaing
Sola! where? where?
Here.
Tell him there's a post come from my master
his horn full of good news: my master will be here
ere morning.
Exit
Sweet soul
And yet no matter: why should we go in?
My friend Stephano
And bring your music forth into the air.
Exit Stephano
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
But in his motion like an angel sings
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in
Enter Musicians
Come
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear
Music
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
The reason is
For do but note a wild and wanton herd
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees
Since nought so stockish
The man that hath no music in himself
The motions of his spirit are dull as night
And his affections dark as Erebus:
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
When the moon shone
So doth the greater glory dim the less:
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Unto the king be by
Empties itself
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
It is your music
Nothing is good
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
Silence bestows that virtue on it
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
The nightingale
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are
To their right praise and true perfection!
Peace
And would not be awaked.
Music ceases
That is the voice
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
Dear lady
We have been praying for our husbands' healths
Are they return'd?
Madam
But there is come a messenger before
Go in
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence;
Nor you
A tucket sounds
Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
We are no tell-tales
This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day
Enter BASSANIO
We should hold day with the Antipodes
Let me give light
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband
But God sort all! You are welcome home
I thank you
This is the man
You should in all sense be much bound to him.
For
No more than I am well acquitted of.
Sir
It must appear in other ways than words
[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
In faith
Would he were gelt that had it
A quarrel
About a hoop of gold
That she did give me
For all the world like cutler's poetry
Upon  a knife
What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me
Gave it a judge's clerk! no
He will
Ay
Now
I could not for my heart deny it him.
You were to blame
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it; and here he stands;
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger
That the world masters. Now
An 'twere to me
[Aside]  Why
And swear I lost the ring defending it.
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
Deserved it too; and then the boy
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings.
What ring gave you my lord?
Not that
If I could add a lie unto a fault
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven
Until I see the ring.
Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine.
Sweet Portia
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring
If you had known the virtue of the ring
What man is there so much unreasonable
With any terms of zeal
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
No
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend. What should I say
I was enforced to send it after him;
I was beset with shame and courtesy;
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me
For
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved
I'll not deny him any thing I have
Know him I shall
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
If you do not
And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.
Well
For if I do
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
Sir
Portia
And
Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye
Nay
Pardon this fault
I never more will break an oath with thee.

Of what quality was your love
Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
where I erected it.
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
When I have told you that
Some say

there is shrewd construction made of her. Now

O
Believe it
it
give me so much of your time in exchange of it
to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
consent to you: if any man may
any.
Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
O
the excellency of her honour
soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
be looked against. Now

could drive her then from the ward of her purity

O good sir!
I say you shall.
Want no money
Want no Mistress Ford
none. I shall be with her
own appointment; even as you came in to me
assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
know how I speed.
I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford
Hang him
yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
and there's my harvest-home.
I would you knew Ford
if you saw him.
Hang him
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
cuckold's horns. Master Brook
will predominate over the peasant
lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
Ford's a knave

cuckold. Come to me soon at night.

What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the

woman! My bed shall be abused

For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you

O you panderly rascals! there's a knot

Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!
Why
loose any longer; you must be pinioned.
Why
Indeed
So say I too
Re-enter MISTRESS FORD
Come hither
woman
hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect
without cause
Heaven be my witness you do
any dishonesty.
Well said
Pulling clothes out of the basket
This passes!
Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.
I shall find you anon.
'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's
clothes? Come away.
Empty the basket
Why
Master Page
out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:
my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
Pluck me out all the linen.
If you find a man there
Here's no man.
By my fidelity
wrongs you.
Master Ford

Well
No
Help to search my house this one time. If I find
not what I seek

walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;
once more search with me.
What
down; my husband will come into the chamber.
Old woman! what old woman's that?
Nay
A witch
forbid her my house? She comes of errands
she? We are simple men; we do not know what's
brought to pass under the profession of
fortune-telling. She works by charms

I'll prat her.

Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the
poor woman.
Nay

By the yea and no

I spy a great peard under his muffler.
Will you follow
see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
upon no trail
Let's obey his humour a little further: come
Exeunt FORD
Trust me
Nay

Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?
Yes

What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
gentlemen: they speak English?
Ay
They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;
I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at

SCENE IV. A room in FORD'S house.
Enter PAGE
'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever
I did look upon.
And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
Within a quarter of an hour.
Pardon me
I rather will suspect the sun with cold
Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand
In him that was of late an heretic
'Tis well
Be not as extreme in submission
As in offence.
But let our plot go forward: let our wives
Yet once again
There is no better way than that they spoke of.
How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park
at midnight? Fie
You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks
there should be terrors in him that he should not
come; methinks his flesh is punished
no desires.
So think I too.
Devise but how you'll use him when he comes
There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
You have heard of such a spirit
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.
Why
In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:
But what of this?
Marry
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.
Well
And in this shape when you have brought him thither
That likewise have we thought upon
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
Like urchins
With some diffused song: upon their sight
Then let them all encircle him about
And
In shape profane.
And till he tell the truth
And burn him with their tapers.
The truth being known
The children must
Be practised well to this
I will teach the children their behaviors; and I
will be like a jack-an-apes also
knight with my taber.
That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.
My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies
That silk will I go buy.
Aside
And in that time
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.
Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
He'll tell me all his purpose: sure
Fear not you that. Go get us properties
And tricking for our fairies.
Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery
honest knaveries.

Well said
And leave your jealousies too
I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
able to woo her in good English.
Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it
it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
with a piece of toasted cheese.
Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.
'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
through the realm.
Why Sir John
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell
What
A puffed man?
Old
And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
And as poor as Job?
And as wicked as his wife?
And given to fornications
and wine and metheglins
swearings and starings
Well
am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
me as you will.
Marry

that you have suffered

Pardon
Now
Why went you not with master doctor
You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
You would have married her most shamefully
The truth is
The offence is holy that she hath committed;
And this deceit loses the name of craft
A thousand irreligious cursed hours
Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;
Money buys lands
I am glad

Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon: but
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires
Long withering out a young man revenue.
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon
New-bent in heaven
Of our solemnities.

Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.

Full of vexation come I
Against my child
Stand forth
Stand forth
Thou
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
With bracelets of thy hair
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart
Consent to marry with Demetrius
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death
Immediately provided in that case.
What say you
To you your father should be as a god;
One that composed your beauties
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
So is Lysander.
In himself he is;
But in this kind
I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case
Either to die the death or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore
Know of your youth
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
Grows
So will I grow
Unto his lordship
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
Take time to pause; and
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.
Relent
Thy crazed title to my certain right.
You have her father's love
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
Scornful Lysander! true
And she is mine
I do estate unto Demetrius.
I am
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd
And
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius
I must confess that I have heard so much
But
And come
For you
To fit your fancies to your father's will;
Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
Which by no means we may extenuate--
To death
Come
Demetrius and Egeus
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
With duty and desire we follow you.
Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
How now
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
Belike for want of rain
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
Ay me! for aught that I could ever read
But
O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
Or else misgraffed in respect of years
O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends
O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
Or
Brief as the lightning in the collied night
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
So quick bright things come to confusion.
If then true lovers have been ever cross'd
Then let us teach our trial patience
A good persuasion: therefore
I have a widow aunt
Of great revenue
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
And she respects me as her only son.
There
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then
And in the wood
My good Lysander!
I swear to thee
Keep promise
Enter HELENA
God speed fair Helena! whither away?
Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear
Sickness is catching: O
My ear should catch your voice
Were the world mine
O
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
I frown upon him
O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
I give him curses
O that my prayers could such affection move!
The more I hate
The more I love
His folly
None
Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see
O
Helen
To-morrow night
Her silver visage in the watery glass
And in the wood
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes
Farewell
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Keep word
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
I will
Exit HERMIA
Helena
As you on him
Exit
How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs
Things base and vile
Love looks not with the eyes
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks
But herein mean I to enrich my pain

You
What is Pyramus? a lover
A lover
That will ask some tears in the true performing of
it: if I do it
eyes; I will move storms
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely
tear a cat in
The raging rocks
And shivering shocks
Shall break the locks
Of prison gates;
And Phibbus' car
Shall shine from far
And make and mar
The foolish Fates.
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
This is Ercles' vein
more condoling.

and that were enough to hang us all.
That would hang us
I grant you
ladies out of their wits
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any

You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
sweet-faced man; a proper man
summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
Well

Why
I will discharge it in either your straw-colour

Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath
A lovely boy

Knight of his train
But she perforce withholds the loved boy
And now they never meet in grove or green
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.

Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
That frights the maidens of the villagery;
Skim milk
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
Mislead night-wanderers
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck
Are not you he?
Thou speak'st aright;
I am that merry wanderer of the night.
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt
Then slip I from her bum
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
But
And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
Enter
Ill met by moonlight
What
I have forsworn his bed and company.
Tarry
Then I must be thy lady: but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here
But that
To give their bed joy and prosperity.
How canst thou thus for shame
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
From Perigenia
And make him with fair AEgle break his faith
These are the forgeries of jealousy:
And never
Therefore the winds
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
Have every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Therefore the moon
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is
Their wonted liveries
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate
We are their parents and original.
Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
I do but beg a little changeling boy
Set your heart at rest:
The fairy land buys not the child of me.
His mother was a votaress of my order:
And
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Which she
Following
Would imitate
But she
And for her sake do I rear up her boy
How long within this wood intend you stay?
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels
If not
Give me that boy
Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies
We shall chide downright
Exit TITANIA with her train
Well
Till I torment thee for this injury.
My gentle Puck
Since once I sat upon a promontory
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
I remember.
That very time I saw
At a fair vestal throned by the west
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
I'll put a girdle round about the earth
In forty minutes.
Exit
Having once this juice
The next thing then she waking looks upon
And ere I take this charm from off her sight
But who comes here? I am invisible;
And I will overhear their conference.
Enter DEMETRIUS
I love thee not
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
The one I'll slay
Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
And here am I
Hence
You draw me
But yet you draw not iron
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw
Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
Or
Tell you
And even for that do I love you the more.
I am your spaniel; and
Use me but as your spaniel
What worser place can I beg in your love
And yet a place of high respect with me
Than to be used as you use your dog?
Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
For I am sick when I do look on thee.
And I am sick when I look not on you.
You do impeach your modesty too much
Into the hands of one that loves you not;
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place
With the rich worth of your virginity.
Your virtue is my privilege: for that
It is not night when I do see your face
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
Then how can it be said I am alone
I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes
The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
Run when you will
Apollo flies
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed
I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
Or
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
Ay
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
We cannot fight for love
We should be wood and were not made to woo.
Exit DEMETRIUS
I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell
Exit
Fare thee well
Re-enter PUCK
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome
Ay
I pray thee
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes
Take thou some of it
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on.
Effect it with some care
More fond on her than she upon her love:
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
Fear not
Exeunt
SCENE II. Another part of the wood.
Enter TITANIA
Come
Then
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
Then to your offices and let me rest.
The Fairies sing
You spotted snakes with double tongue
Newts and blind-worms
Philomel
Sing in our sweet lullaby;
Lulla
Never harm
So
Weaving spiders
Hence
Beetles black
Worm nor snail
Philomel
Hence
One aloof stand sentinel.
Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps
Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids
What thou seest when thou dost wake
Be it ounce
When thou wakest
Wake when some vile thing is near.
Exit
Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA
Fair love
And to speak troth
We'll rest us
Be it so
For I upon this bank will rest my head.
One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
One heart
Nay
O
Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
I mean
So that but one heart we can make of it;
Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
So then two bosoms and a single troth.
Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
For lying so
Lysander riddles very prettily:
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride
But
Lie further off; in human modesty
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
Amen
And then end life when I end loyalty!
Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
They sleep
Enter PUCK
Through the forest have I gone.
But Athenian found I none
This flower's force in stirring love.
Night and silence.--Who is here?
Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
This is he
And here the maiden
Pretty soul! she durst not lie
Near this lack-love
Churl
All the power this charm doth owe.
When thou wakest
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
So awake when I am gone;
For I must now to Oberon.
Exit
Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA
Stay
I charge thee
O
Stay
Exit
O
The more my prayer
Happy is Hermia
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
If so
No
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood
Lysander if you live
[Awaking]  And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art
Where is Demetrius? O
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
Do not say so
What though he love your Hermia? Lord
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
Not Hermia but Helena I love:
Who will not change a raven for a dove?
The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
Things growing are not ripe until their season
So I
And touching now the point of human skill
And leads me to your eyes
Love's stories written in love's richest book.
Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
Is't not enough
Good troth
But fare you well: perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
O
Should of another therefore be abused!
Exit
She sees not Hermia. Hermia
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings
Are hated most of those they did deceive
And
To honour Helen and to be her knight!
Exit
[Awaking]  Help me
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
Ay me
Lysander
Methought a serpent eat my heart away
Lysander! what
What
Alack
Speak
No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
Either death or you I'll find immediately.
Exit
ACT III
SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.
Enter QUINCE
Are we all met?
Pat
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
stage
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
Peter Quince
What sayest thou
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
Thisby that will never please. First
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
cannot abide. How answer you that?
By'r lakin
I believe we must leave the killing out
Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
say
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and
better assurance
Pyramus
out of fear.
Well
written in eight and six.
No
Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
I fear it
Masters
bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
look to 't.
Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
Nay
be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
must speak through
defect
You
entreat you
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
his name
Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
that is
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
A calendar
out moonshine
Yes
Why
chamber window
may shine in at the casement.
Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
and a lanthorn
present
another thing: we must have a wall in the great
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story
talk through the chink of a wall.
You can never bring in a wall. What say you
Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
have some plaster
about him
fingers thus
and Thisby whisper.
If that may be
Pyramus
speech
according to his cue.
Enter PUCK behind
What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here
What
An actor too
Speak
Thisby
Odours
--odours savours sweet:
So hath thy breath
But hark
Exit
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
Exit
Must I speak now?
Ay
but to see a noise that he heard
Most radiant Pyramus
'Ninus' tomb
yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
part at once
is past; it is
O
never tire.
Re-enter PUCK
If I were fair
O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray
Exeunt QUINCE
I'll follow you
Sometime a horse I'll be
And neigh
Exit
Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
make me afeard.
Re-enter SNOUT
O Bottom
What do you see? you see an asshead of your own
you?
Exit SNOUT
Re-enter QUINCE
Bless thee
translated.
Exit
I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
to fright me
from this place
and down here
I am not afraid.
Sings
The ousel cock so black of hue
[Awaking]  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
[Sings]
The finch
for
a bird? who would give a bird the lie
'cuckoo' never so?
I pray thee
Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
On the first view to say
Methinks
for that: and yet
love keep little company together now-a-days; the
more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
make them friends. Nay
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
Not so
of this wood
Out of this wood do not desire to go:
Thou shalt remain here
I am a spirit of no common rate;
The summer still doth tend upon my state;
And I do love thee: therefore
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
Enter PEASEBLOSSOM
Ready.
And I.
And I.
And I.
Where shall we go?
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
Nod to him
Hail
Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
I cry your worship's mercy
worship's name.
Cobweb.
I shall desire you of more acquaintance
Cobweb: if I cut my finger
you. Your name
Peaseblossom.
I pray you
mother
Master Peaseblossom
acquaintance too. Your name
Mustardseed.
Good Master Mustardseed
that same cowardly
devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
desire your more acquaintance
Mustardseed.
Come
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
And when she weeps
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Another part of the wood.
Enter OBERON
I wonder if Titania be awaked;
Then
Enter PUCK
Here comes my messenger.
How now
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take
Anon his Thisbe must be answered
And
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak
thus strong
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves
things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear
When in that moment
This falls out better than I could devise.
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
With the love-juice
I took him sleeping
And the Athenian woman by his side:
That
Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS
Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
This is the woman
O
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me: would he have stolen away
From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
May through the centre creep and so displease
Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
So should a murderer look
So should the murder'd look
Yet you
What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
Ah
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
Out
Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him
Henceforth be never number'd among men!
O
Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake
Could not a worm
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
Than thine
You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
Nor is he dead
I pray thee
An if I could
A privilege never to see me more.
And from thy hated presence part I so:
See me no more
Exit
There is no following her in this fierce vein:
Here therefore for a while I will remain.
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
Which now in some slight measure it will pay
Lies down and sleeps
What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
Then fate o'er-rules
About the wood go swifter than the wind
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer
By some illusion see thou bring her here:
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
I go
Exit
Flower of this purple dye
When his love he doth espy
As the Venus of the sky.
When thou wakest
Re-enter PUCK
Captain of our fairy band
And the youth
Shall we their fond pageant see?
Lord
Stand aside: the noise they make
Will cause Demetrius to awake.
Then will two at once woo one;
That must needs be sport alone;
And those things do best please me
That befal preposterously.
Enter LYSANDER and HELENA
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
Scorn and derision never come in tears:
Look
How can these things in me seem scorn to you
You do advance your cunning more and more.
When truth kills truth
These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
Weigh oath with oath
Your vows to her and me
I had no judgment when to her I swore.
Nor none
Demetrius loves her
[Awaking]  O Helena
To what
Crystal is muddy. O
Thy lips
That pure congealed white
When thou hold'st up thy hand: O
This princess of pure white
O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment:
If you we re civil and knew courtesy
Can you not hate me
If you were men
To vow
You both are rivals
And now both rivals
A trim exploit
With your derision! none of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin
A poor soul's patience
You are unkind
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
And here
And yours of Helena to me bequeath
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
Lysander
If e'er I loved her
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd
Helen
Disparage not the faith thou dost not know
Look
Re-enter HERMIA
Dark night
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
Thou art not by mine eye
Mine ear
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
Why should he stay
What love could press Lysander from my side?
Lysander's love
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know
You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
Lo
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
To fashion this false sport
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared
For parting us
All school-days' friendship
We
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
So
Two of the first
And will you rent our ancient love asunder
It is not friendly
Our sex
I am amazed at your passionate words.
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
Have you not set Lysander
And made your other love
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love
What thought I be not so in grace as you
This you should pity rather than despise.
I understand not what you mean by this.
Ay
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
This sport
If you have any pity
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
Stay
My love
O excellent!
Sweet
If she cannot entreat
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
Helen
I swear by that which I will lose for thee
I say I love thee more than he can do.
If thou say so
Quick
Lysander
Away
No
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow
Hang off
Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
Sweet love
Thy love! out
Out
Do you not jest?
Yes
Demetrius
I would I had your bond
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
What
Although I hate her
What
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
me:
Why
In earnest
Ay
And never did desire to see thee more.
Therefore be out of hope
Be certain
That I do hate thee and love Helena.
O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
You thief of love! what
And stolen my love's heart from him?
Fine
Have you no modesty
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie
Puppet? why so? ay
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
And with her personage
And are you grown so high in his esteem;
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
How low am I
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
I pray you
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think
Lower! hark
Good Hermia
I evermore did love you
Save that
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
To strike me
And now
And follow you no further: let me go:
You see how simple and how fond I am.
Why
A foolish heart
What
With Demetrius.
Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee
No
O
She was a vixen when she went to school;
And though she be but little
'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.
Get you gone
You minimus
You bead
You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for
Never so little show of love to her
Now she holds me not;
Now follow
Follow! nay
Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS
You
Nay
I will not trust you
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
Exit
I am amazed
Exit
This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest
Believe me
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garment be had on?
And so far blameless proves my enterprise
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
Hie therefore
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron
As one come not within another's way.
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property
When they next wake
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ
And then I will her charmed eye release
From monster's view
My fairy lord
At whose approach
For fear lest day should look their shames upon
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
But we are spirits of another sort:
I with the morning's love have oft made sport
But
We may effect this business yet ere day.
Exit
Up and down
I am fear'd in field and town:

Here comes one.

I will be with thee straight.
Follow me
Exit LYSANDER
Re-enter DEMETRIUS
Lysander! speak again:
Thou runaway
Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
Thou coward
I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
That draws a sword on thee.
Yea
Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
Exeunt
Re-enter LYSANDER
He goes before me and still dares me on:
When I come where he calls
The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
I follow'd fast
That fallen am I in dark uneven way
Lies down
Come
For if but once thou show me thy grey light
Sleeps
Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS
Ho
Abide me
Thou runn'st before me
Where art thou now?
Come hither: I am here.
Nay
Now
To measure out my length on this cold bed.
By day's approach look to be visited.
Lies down and sleeps
Re-enter HELENA
O weary night
And sleep
Lies down and sleeps
Yet but three? Come one more;
Two of both kinds make up four.
Here she comes
Cupid is a knavish lad
Re-enter HERMIA
Never so weary
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
Here will I rest me till the break of day.
Heavens shield Lysander
Lies down and sleeps
On the ground
Sleep sound:
I'll apply
To your eye
Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes
When thou wakest
True delight
In the sight
Of thy former lady's eye:
And the country proverb known
Jack shall have Jill;
Nought shall go ill;
The man shall have his mare again

methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
am such a tender ass
What
I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have

Truly
dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
of hay: good hay
I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
The squirrel's hoard
I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
But
have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
Sleep thou
Fairies
Exeunt fairies
So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
Gently entwist; the female ivy so
Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
O
They sleep
Enter PUCK
[Advancing]  Welcome
See'st thou this sweet sight?
Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
For
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
And that same dew
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience
Which straight she gave me
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
And now I have the boy
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
And
From off the head of this Athenian swain;
That
And think no more of this night's accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
But first I will release the fairy queen.
Be as thou wast wont to be;
See as thou wast wont to see:
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
Hath such force and blessed power.
Now
My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
There lies your love.
How came these things to pass?
O
Silence awhile. Robin
Titania
Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
Music
Music
Now
own fool's eyes peep.
Sound
Now thou and I are new in amity
Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded
Fairy king
I do hear the morning lark.
Then
We the globe can compass soon
Come
Tell me how it came this night
That I sleeping here was found

I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
Such gallant chiding: for
Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
So musical a discord
My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind
With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
Crook-knee'd
Slow in pursuit

More strange than true: I never may believe

Lovers and madmen have such seething brains
More than cool reason ever comprehends.

Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold
The poet's eye
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing

A play there is
But by ten words
There is not one word apt

What are they that do play it?
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here

How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes

She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
her passion ends the play.

Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
I am sent with broom before

Through the house give gathering light
Every elf and fairy sprite
Hop as light as bird from brier;

Hand in hand

Now
To the best bride-bed will we
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate.
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be;
And the blots of Nature's hand
Shall not in their issue stand;
Never mole
Despised in nativity
With this field-dew consecrate
And each several chamber bless
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in safety rest.
Trip away; make no stay;
Meet me all by break of day.
Exeunt OBERON

ACT I
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.
Enter LEONATO
I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
comes this night to Messina.
He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
when I left him.
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
But few of any sort
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
promise of his age
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
tell you how.
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
glad of it.
I have already delivered him letters
appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
not show itself modest enough without a badge of
bitterness.
Did he break out into tears?
In great measure.
A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
truer than those that are so washed. How much
better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
I pray you
wars or no?
I know none of that name
in the army of any sort.
What is he that you ask for
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
O
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool
the challenge
him at the bird-bolt. I pray you
killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
Faith
but he'll be meet with you
He hath done good service
You had musty victual
he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
excellent stomach.
And a good soldier too
And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
A lord to a lord
honourable virtues.
It is so
but for the stuffing
You must not
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
between them.
Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
conflict four of his five wits went halting off
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
he have wit enough to keep himself warm
bear it for a difference between himself and his
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
Is't possible?
Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
next block.
I see
No; an he were
you
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
O Lord
is sooner caught than the pestilence
runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
he have caught the Benedick
thousand pound ere a' be cured.
I will hold friends with you
Do
You will never run mad
No
Don Pedro is approached.
Enter DON PEDRO
Good Signior Leonato
trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
cost
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
your grace: for trouble being gone
remain; but when you depart from me
and happiness takes his leave.
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
is your daughter.
Her mother hath many times told me so.
Were you in doubt
Signior Benedick
You have it full
what you are
herself. Be happy
honourable father.
If Signior Leonato be her father
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina
like him as she is.
I wonder that you will still be talking
Benedick: nobody marks you.
What
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain
in her presence.
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
am loved of all ladies
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
heart; for
A dear happiness to women: they would else have
been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
and my cold blood
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
swear he loves me.
God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
scratched face.
Scratching could not make it worse
a face as yours were.
Well
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue
so good a continuer. But keep your way
name; I have done.
You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
That is the sum of all
and Signior Benedick
invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
the least a month; and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
hypocrite
If you swear
To DON JOHN
Let me bid you welcome
the prince your brother
I thank you: I am not of many words
you.
Please it your grace lead on?

Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO
Benedick
I noted her not; but I looked on her.
Is she not a modest young lady?
Do you question me
my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
after my custom
No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
Why
praise
for a great praise: only this commendation I can
afford her
were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is
do not like her.
Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
truly how thou likest her.
Would you buy her
Can the world buy such a jewel?
Yea
with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack
rare carpenter? Come
you
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
looked on.
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
matter: there's her cousin
possessed with a fury
as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
hope you have no intent to turn husband
I would scarce trust myself
contrary
Is't come to this? In faith
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
Go to
into a yoke
Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
Re-enter DON PEDRO
What secret hath held you here
not to Leonato's?
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
I charge thee on thy allegiance.
You hear
man; I would have you think so; but
allegiance
in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero
short daughter.
If this were so
Like the old tale
'twas not so
so.'
If my passion change not shortly
should be otherwise.
Amen
You speak this to fetch me in
By my troth
And
And
That I love her
That she is worthy
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
know how she should be worthy
fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
of beauty.
And never could maintain his part but in the force
of his will.
That a woman conceived me
brought me up
thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
forehead
them the wrong to mistrust any
right to trust none; and the fine is
I may go the finer
I shall see thee
With anger
with love than I will get again with drinking
out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
blind Cupid.
Well
wilt prove a notable argument.
If I do
at me; and he that hits me
the shoulder
Well
doth bear the yoke.'
The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
Benedick bear it
them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted
good horse to hire
'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
If this should ever happen
Nay
Venice
I look for an earthquake too
Well
meantime
Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
great preparation.
I have almost matter enough in me for such an
embassage; and so I commit you--
To the tuition of God: From my house
The sixth of July: Your loving friend
Nay
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments
the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
you flout old ends any further
conscience: and so I leave you.
Exit
My liege
My love is thine to teach: teach it but how
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
Hath Leonato any son
No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
Dost thou affect her
O
Than to drive liking to the name of love:
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
Have left their places vacant
Come thronging soft and delicate desires
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
How sweetly you do minister to love
But lest my liking might too sudden seem
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look
I know we shall have revelling to-night:
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
Then after to her father will I break;
And the conclusion is
In practise let us put it presently.

What the good-year

There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
therefore the sadness is without limit.
You should hear reason.
And when I have heard it
If not a present remedy

I wonder that thou
medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
at no man's jests
for no man's leisure
tend on no man's business
claw no man in his humour.
Yea
till you may do it without controlment. You have of
late stood out against your brother
ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
impossible you should take true root but by the
fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
that you frame the season for your own harvest.
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
his grace
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
love from any: in this
be a flattering honest man
but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
mouth
my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
seek not to alter me.
Can you make no use of your discontent?
I make all use of it
Who comes here?
Enter BORACHIO
What news
I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
unquietness?
Marry
Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
Even he.
A proper squire! And who
he?
Marry
A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
Being entertained for a perfumer
musty room
in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
prince should woo Hero for himself

Come

glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way
bless myself every way. You are both sure

Was not Count John here at supper?
I saw him not.
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
He were an excellent man that were made just in the
midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
like an image and says nothing

end.
Will you not tell me who told you so?
No
Nor will you not tell me who you are?
Not now.
That I was disdainful
out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
Signior Benedick that said so.
What's he?
I am sure you know him well enough.
Not I
Did he never make you laugh?
I pray you
Why
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
none but libertines delight in him; and the
commendation is not in his wit
for he both pleases men and angers them
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
the fleet: I would he had boarded me.
When I know the gentleman

Music
We must follow the leaders.
In every good thing.
Nay
the next turning.
Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.
And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.
Are not you Signior Benedick?
You know me well; I am he.
Signior
he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you
from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
do the part of an honest man in it.
How know you he loves her?
I heard him swear his affection.
So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.
Come
Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick
'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love:
Therefore
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof
Re-enter BENEDICK
Count Claudio?
Yea
Come
Whither?
Even to the next willow
about your neck
your arm

I wish him joy of her.
Why

have served you thus?
I pray you
Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
boy that stole your meat

Exit
Alas
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me
know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
under that title because I am merry. Yea
am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
is the base
that puts the world into her person and so gives me
out. Well
Re-enter DON PEDRO
Now
Troth
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
warren: I told him
lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree
to bind him up a rod
To be whipped! What's his fault?
The flat transgression of a schoolboy
overjoyed with finding a birds' nest
companion
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
transgression is in the stealer.
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made
worn himself
you
I will but teach them to sing
the owner.
If their singing answer your saying
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
wronged by you.
O
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her. She told me
myself
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark
me. She speaks poniards
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations
the north star. I would not marry her
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
turned spit
the fire too. Come
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly
she is here
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose
would go thither; so
and perturbation follows her.
Look
Enter CLAUDIO
Will your grace command me any service to the
world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the

Speak
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
but little happy
you are mine

Speak
with a kiss
In faith
Yea

ear that he is in her heart.
And so she doth
Good Lord

corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!
Lady Beatrice
I would rather have one of your father's getting.
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
father got excellent husbands

Your silence most offends me

By my troth
There's little of the melancholy element in her
lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps
not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say
herself with laughing.
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
O
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
O Lord
County Claudio
To-morrow
have all his rites.
Not till Monday
seven-night; and a time too brief
things answer my mind.
Come
but
dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
Hercules' labours; which is
Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
affection the one with the other. I would fain have
it a match
you three will but minister such assistance as I
shall give you direction.
My lord
nights' watchings.
And I
And you too
I will do any modest office
cousin to a good husband.
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
strain
will teach you how to humour your cousin
shall fall in love with Benedick; and I
two helps
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach
shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this
ours
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same.
Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO
It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
daughter of Leonato.
Yea
Any bar
medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him
evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
Not honestly
dishonesty shall appear in me.
Show me briefly how.
I think I told your lordship a year since
I am in the favour of Margaret
gentlewoman to Hero.
I remember.
I can
What life is in that
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
up--to a contaminated stale
What proof shall I make of that?
Proof enough to misuse the prince
other issue?
Only to despite them
Go
the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
prince and Claudio
honour
reputation
semblance of a maid
thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
offer them instances; which shall bear no less
likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window
Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
before the intended wedding
will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
absent
of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
Grow this to what adverse issue it can
it in practise. Be cunning in the working this
thy fee is a thousand ducats.
Be you constant in the accusation
shall not shame me.
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
Exeunt
SCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.
Enter BENEDICK
Boy!
Enter Boy
Signior?
In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
to me in the orchard.
I am here already
I know that; but I would have thee hence
Exit Boy
I do much wonder that one man
another man is a fool when he dedicates his
behaviors to love
such shallow follies in others
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake
speak plain and to the purpose
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
words are a very fantastical banquet
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
be sworn
I'll take my oath on it
of me

well; another virtuous

See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

Enter BALTHASAR with Music
Come
O
To slander music any more than once.
It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection.
I pray thee
Because you talk of wooing
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
To her he thinks not worthy
Now
Or
Note this before my notes;
There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.

Do so: farewell.
Exit BALTHASAR
Come hither
to-day
Signior Benedick?
O
never think that lady would have loved any man.
No

all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
By my troth
of it but that she loves him with an enraged
affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
May be she doth but counterfeit.
Faith
O God
passion came so near the life of passion as she
discovers it.
Why
Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
What effects
my daughter tell you how.
She did
How
thought her spirit had been invincible against all
assaults of affection.
I would have sworn it had
against Benedick.
I should think this a gull
white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot
He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
'Tis true
I
with scorn
This says she now when she is beginning to write to
him; for she'll be up twenty times a night
there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
Now you talk of a sheet of paper
pretty jest your daughter told us of.
O
found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
That.
O
railed at herself
to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
measure him
should flout him
love him
Then down upon her knees she falls
sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
to herself: it is very true.
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
other
To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
torment the poor lady worse.
An he should
excellent sweet lady; and
And she is exceeding wise.
In every thing but in loving Benedick.
O
a body
the victory. I am sorry for her
cause
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
have daffed all other respects and made her half
myself. I pray you
what a' will say.
Were it good
Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
will die
she make her love known
her
accustomed crossness.
She doth well: if she should make tender of her
love
man
He is a very proper man.
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
Before God! and
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
And I take him to be valiant.
As Hector
quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
avoids them with great discretion
them with a most Christian-like fear.
If he do fear God
if he break the peace
quarrel with fear and trembling.
And so will he do; for the man doth fear God
he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
we go seek Benedick
Never tell him
good counsel.
Nay
Well
let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
could wish he would modestly examine himself
how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
My lord
If he do not dote on her upon this
trust my expectation.
Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
sport will be
another's dotage
scene that I would see
dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
Exeunt DON PEDRO
[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the
conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
why
they say I will bear myself proudly
the love come from her; they say too that she will
rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
are they that hear their detractions and can put
them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
truth
so
me; by my troth
no great argument of her folly
horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me
doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
No

she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
her.
Enter BEATRICE
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
Fair Beatrice
I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
pains to thank me: if it had been painful
not have come.
You take pleasure then in the message?
Yea
point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach
Exit
Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
to thank me.' that's as much as to say
that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
not take pity of her

ACT III
SCENE I. LEONATO'S garden.
Enter HERO
Good Margaret
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
Whisper her ear and tell her
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
And bid her steal into the pleached bower
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
I'll make her come
Exit
Now
When I do name him
To praise him more than ever man did merit:
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made
Enter BEATRICE
Now begin;
For look where Beatrice
Close by the ground
The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream
So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
Then go we near her
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
Approaching the bower
No
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggerds of the rock.
But are you sure
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
And did they bid you tell her of it
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
But I persuaded them
Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man:
But Nature never framed a woman's heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love
Sure
And therefore certainly it were not good
She knew his love
Why
If black
If low
If speaking
If silent
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
Sure
No
As Beatrice is
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak
Out of myself
Therefore let Benedick
It were a better death than die with mocks
Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
No; rather I will go to Benedick
And counsel him to fight against his passion.
And
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
How much an ill word may empoison liking.
O
She cannot be so much without true judgment--
Having so swift and excellent a wit
As she is prized to have--as to refuse
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
He is the only man of Italy.
Always excepted my dear Claudio.
I pray you
Indeed
His excellence did earn it
When are you married
Why
I'll show thee some attires
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.
She's limed
If it proves so
Some Cupid kills with arrows
Exeunt HERO and URSULA
[Coming forward]
What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
Contempt
No glory lives behind the back of such.
And
If thou dost love
To bind our loves up in a holy band;
For others say thou dost deserve
Believe it better than reportingly.

I do but stay till your marriage be consummate

I'll bring you thither

Nay
of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
with Benedick for his company; for
of his head to the sole of his foot
mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
tongue is the clapper

I hope he be in love.
Hang him

I have the toothache.
Draw it.
Hang it!
You must hang it first
What! sigh for the toothache?
Where is but a humour or a worm.
Well
it.
Yet say I
There is no appearance of fancy in him
a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as
a Dutchman today
shape of two countries at once
the waist downward
the hip upward
to this foolery
fool for fancy
If he be not in love with some woman
believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
mornings; what should that bode?
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
No
stuffed tennis-balls.
Indeed
Nay
out by that?
That's as much as to say
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
And when was he wont to wash his face?
Yea
what they say of him.
Nay
a lute-string and now governed by stops.
Indeed
Nay
That would I know too: I warrant
Yes

She shall be buried with her face upwards.
Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old

If your leisure served
In private?
If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
what I would speak of concerns him.
What's the matter?
[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be married
to-morrow?
You know he does.
I know not that
If there be any impediment
You may think I love you not: let that appear

your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
labour ill bestowed.

Even she; Leonato's Hero
Disloyal?
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
could say she were worse: think you of a worse
title
further warrant: go but with me to-night
see her chamber-window entered
before her wedding-day: if you love her then
to change your mind.
May this be so?
I will not think it.
If you dare not trust that you see
that you know: if you will follow me
you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
more
If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
her to-morrow in the congregation
wed
And
with thee to disgrace her.
I will disparage her no farther till you are my
witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight

O mischief strangely thwarting!
O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
you have seen the sequel.

Come hither
you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
Both which
You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well
no boast of it; and for your writing and reading
vanity. You are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
to bid any man stand
How if a' will not stand?
Why
presently call the rest of the watch together and
thank God you are rid of a knave.
If he will not stand when he is bidden
of the prince's subjects.
TRUE
prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
the streets; for
talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
belongs to a watch.
Why
watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
offend: only
stolen. Well
ale-houses
How if they will not?
Why
they make you not then the better answer
say they are not the men you took them for.
Well
If you meet a thief
of your office
kind of men
If we know him to be a thief
hands on him?
Truly
that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
way for you
show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
You have been always called a merciful man
Truly
a man who hath any honesty in him.
If you hear a child cry in the night
to the nurse and bid her still it.
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
Why
her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
'Tis very true.
This is the end of the charge:--you
to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
prince in the night
Nay
Five shillings to one on't

to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will.

Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
have need of poor ones
price they will.
I wonder at it.
That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
the fashion of a doublet
nothing to a man.
Yes
I mean
Yes
Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
is?
[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a
gentleman: I remember his name.
Didst thou not hear somebody?
No; 'twas the vane on the house.
Seest thou not
fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
in the reeky painting
priests in the old church-window
shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry
All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
thyself giddy with the fashion too
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
Not so

at the temple

not to think what I can

To be married to her: friar
Lady
I do.
If either of you know any inward impediment why you
should not be conjoined
Know you any
None
Know you any
I dare make his answer
O
do
How now! interjections? Why
laughing
Stand thee by
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
Give me this maid
As freely
And what have I to give you back
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
Nothing
Sweet prince
There
Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
O
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
Comes not that blood as modest evidence
To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
Her blush is guiltiness
What do you mean
Not to be married
Dear my lord
I know what you would say: if I have known her
No
But
Bashful sincerity and comely love.
And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
You seem to me as Dian in her orb
But you are more intemperate in your blood
Than Venus
That rage in savage sensuality.
Is my lord well
Sweet prince
What should I speak?
I stand dishonour'd
To link my dear friend to a common stale.
Are these things spoken
Sir
This looks not like a nuptial.
True! O God!
Leonato
Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?
All this is so: but what of this
Let me but move one question to your daughter;
And
That you have in her
I charge thee do so
O
What kind of catechising call you this?
To make you answer truly to your name.
Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
With any just reproach?
Marry
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
Now
I talk'd with no man at that hour
Why
Did see her
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
Who hath indeed
A thousand times in secret.
Fie
There is not chastity enough in language
Without offence to utter them. Thus
O Hero
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
But fare thee well
For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love
Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
HERO swoons
Why
Come
Exeunt DON PEDRO
How doth the lady?
Dead
Hero! why
O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
Death is the fairest cover for her shame
That may be wish'd for.
How now
Have comfort
Dost thou look up?
Yea
Wherefore! Why
Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
The story that is printed in her blood?
Do not live
For
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
O
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
Why had I not with charitable hand
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
And mine that I was proud on
That I myself was to myself not mine
Into a pit of ink
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
And salt too little which may season give
To her foul-tainted flesh!
Sir
For my part
O
Lady
No
Confirm'd
Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
Would the two princes lie
Hear me a little;
For I have only been silent so long
And given way unto this course of fortune.
...
By noting of the lady I have mark'd
A thousand blushing apparitions
To start into her face
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
Trust not my reading nor my observations
The tenor of my book; trust not my age
Under some biting error.
Friar
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
Is that she will not add to her damnation
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
That which appears in proper nakedness?
Lady
They know that do accuse me; I know none:
If I know more of any man alive
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
At hours unmeet
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature
There is some strange misprision in the princes.
Two of them have the very bent of honour;
And if their wisdoms be misled in this
I know not. If they speak but truth of her
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
Pause awhile
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
Let her awhile be secretly kept in
Maintain a mourning ostentation
And on your family's old monument
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
That appertain unto a burial.
What shall become of this? what will this do?
Marry
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
But not for that dream I on this strange course
She dying
Of every hearer: for it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Whiles we enjoy it
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
When he shall hear she died upon his words
Into his study of imagination
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit
Let this be so
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
But if all aim but this be levell'd false
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
And if it sort not well
Signior Leonato
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body.
Being that I flow in grief
'Tis well consented: presently away;
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
Come
Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE
Lady Beatrice
Yea
I will not desire that.
You have no reason; I do it freely.
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
Ah
Is there any way to show such friendship?
A very even way
May a man do it?
It is a man's office
I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
not that strange?
As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
confess nothing
By my sword
Do not swear
I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
him eat it that says I love not you.
Will you not eat your word?
With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
I love thee.
Why
What offence
You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
protest I loved you.
And do it with all thy heart.
I love you with so much of my heart that none is
left to protest.
Come
Kill Claudio.
Ha! not for the wide world.
You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
Tarry
I am gone

Beatrice
In faith
We'll be friends first.
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
Is Claudio thine enemy?
Is he not approved in the height a villain

Nay

manhood is melted into courtesies

If you go on thus
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
Against yourself.
I pray thee
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
Bring me a father that so loved his child
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
And let it answer every strain for strain
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me
But there is no such man: for
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel; but
Would give preceptial medicine to rage
No
To those that wring under the load of sorrow
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
Therein do men from children nothing differ.
I pray thee
For there was never yet philosopher
That could endure the toothache patiently
And made a push at chance and sufferance.
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
Make those that do offend you suffer too.
There thou speak'st reason: nay
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
And all of them that thus dishonour her.
Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.

Away! I will not have to do with you.
Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:

Win me and wear me; let him answer me.

In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came

We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are

Sweet prince
do you hear me

could not discover
to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
to slander the Lady Hero
the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
garments
marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
master's false accusation; and
nothing but the reward of a villain.
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.
But did my brother set thee on to this?
Yea
He is composed and framed of treachery:
And fled he is upon this villany.
Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
Come

Foul words is but foul wind

will depart unkissed.
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense

I must shortly hear from him
him a coward. And
which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
For them all together; which maintained so politic
a state of evil that they will not admit any good
part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
good parts did you first suffer love for me?
Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
indeed
In spite of your heart
If you spite it for my sake
yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.

For here's a paper written in his hand
And here's another

Is topping your white ewe. Arise
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell
Arise
What
Most reverend signior
"Not I	what are you?"
My name is Roderigo.
The worser welcome:
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now
To start my quiet.
Sir
But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee.
Patience
What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
My house is not a grange.
Most grave Brabantio
'Zounds
serve God
do you service and you think we are ruffians
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
What profane wretch art thou?
I am one
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
Thou art a villain.
You are--a senator.
This thou shalt answer; I know thee
Sir
But with a knave of common hire
If this be known to you and your allowance
But if you know not this
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That
Your daughter
Tying her duty
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house
For thus deluding you.
Strike on the tinder
Give me a taper! call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream:
Belief of it oppresses me already.

Farewell; for I must leave you:
It seems not meet
Against the Moor: for
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars
Yet
And there will I be with him. So
Exit
Enter
It is too true an evil: gone she is;
And what's to come of my despised time
Is nought but bitterness. Now
With the Moor
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
Raise all my kindred. Are they married
Truly
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
Fathers
By what you see them act. Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused? Have you not read
Yes
Call up my brother. O
Some one way
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
I think I can discover him
Pray you
I may command at most. Get weapons
And raise some special officers of night.

Exeunt
SCENE II. Another street.
Enter OTHELLO
Though in the trade of war I have slain men
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
'Tis better as it is.
Nay
Against your honour
That
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law
Let him do his spite:
My services which I have done the signiory
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know
Which
From men of royal siege
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reach'd: for know
Put into circumscription and confine
For the sea's worth. But
Those are the raised father and his friends:
You were best go in.
"Not I	I must be found:"
My parts
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

Enter CASSIO
The servants of the duke
The goodness of the night upon you
What is the news?
The duke does greet you
What is the matter
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
It is a business of some heat: the galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels
hotly call'd for;
When
To search you out.
'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house

'Faith
If it prove lawful prize
I do not understand.
He's married.
To who?
Re-enter OTHELLO
Marry
Have with you.
Here comes another troop to seek for you.
It is Brabantio. General
He comes to bad intent.
Enter BRABANTIO
Holla! stand there!
Signior
Down with him
They draw on both sides
You
Keep up your bright swords
Good signior
Than with your weapons.
O thou foul thief
Damn'd as thou art
For I'll refer me to all things of sense
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation
Of such a thing as thou
Judge me the world
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist
Hold your hands
Were it my cue to fight
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge?
To prison
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer.
What if I do obey?
How may the duke be therewith satisfied
To bring me to him?
'Tis true
The duke's in council and your noble self
How! the duke in council!
In this time of the night! Bring him away:
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself
For if such actions may have passage free
Exeunt
SCENE III. A council-chamber.
The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending
There is no composition in these news
That gives them credit.
Indeed
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
And mine
And mine
But though they jump not on a just account
As in these cases
A Turkish fleet
Nay
I do not so secure me in the error
In fearful sense.
[Within]  What
A messenger from the galleys.
Enter a Sailor
Now
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
So was I bid report here to the state
By Signior Angelo.
How say you by this change?
This cannot be
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk
That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this
To leave that latest which concerns him first
Nay
Here is more news.
Enter a Messenger
The Ottomites
Ay
Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
Their backward course
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano
'Tis certain
Marcus Luccicos
He's now in Florence.
Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
Enter BRABANTIO
Valiant Othello
Against the general enemy Ottoman.
To BRABANTIO
I did not see you; welcome
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
So did I yours. Good your grace
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed
Take hold on me
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
And it is still itself.
Why
My daughter! O
Dead?
Ay
She is abused
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
For nature so preposterously to err
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
And you of her
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
After your own sense
Stood in your action.
Humbly I thank your grace.
Here is the man
Hath hither brought.
We are very sorry for't.
[To OTHELLO]  What
Nothing
Most potent
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith
Their dearest action in the tented field
In speaking for myself. Yet
Of my whole course of love; what drugs
A maiden never bold;
Of spirit so still and quiet
Blush'd at herself; and she
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature
To find out practises of cunning hell
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood
To vouch this
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
But
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
Or came it by request and such fair question
As soul to soul affordeth?
I do beseech you
If you do find me foul in her report
Even fall upon my life.
Fetch Desdemona hither.
Ancient
Exeunt IAGO and Attendants
And
I do confess the vices of my blood
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love
Say it
Her father loved me; oft invited me;
Still question'd me the story of my life
I ran it through
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach
And sold to slavery
And portance in my travels' history:
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
It was my hint to speak
And of the Cannibals that each other eat
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch
Devour up my discourse: which I observing
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done
She swore
She wish'd she had not heard it
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd
This only is the witchcraft I have used:
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
Enter DESDEMONA
I think this tale would win my daughter too.
Good Brabantio
Men do their broken weapons rather use
Than their bare hands.
I pray you
If she confess that she was half the wooer
Light on the man! Come hither
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience?
My noble father
To you I am bound for life and education;
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband
To you
Due to the Moor my lord.
God be wi' you! I have done.
Please it your grace
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
Come hither
I here do give thee that with all my heart
Which
I would keep from thee. For your sake
For thy escape would teach me tyranny
Let me speak like yourself
Into your favour.
When remedies are past
By seeing the worst
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
Patience her injury a mockery makes.
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
We lose it not
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears
That
These sentences
But words are words; I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
I humbly beseech you
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
Cyprus. Othello
known to you; and though we have there a substitute
of most allowed sufficiency
sovereign mistress of effects
voice on you: you must therefore be content to
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.
The tyrant custom
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness
These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most humbly therefore bending to your state
Due reference of place and exhibition
As levels with her breeding.
If you please
I'll not have it so.
Nor I.
Nor I; I would not there reside
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke
And let me find a charter in your voice
What would You
That I did love the Moor to live with him
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord:
I saw Othello's visage in his mind
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
Let her have your voices.
Vouch with me
In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
And heaven defend your good souls
I will your serious and great business scant
For she is with me: no
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
My speculative and officed instruments
Make head against my estimation!
Be it as you shall privately determine
You must away to-night.
With all my heart.
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
Othello
With such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you.
So please your grace
A man he is of honest and trust:
To his conveyance I assign my wife
To be sent after me.
Let it be so.
Good night to every one.
To BRABANTIO
And
Adieu
Look to her
She has deceived her father
Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE
My life upon her faith! Honest Iago
I prithee
And bring them after in the best advantage.
Come
Of love
Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA
Iago
What say'st thou
What will I do
Why
I will incontinently drown myself.
If thou dost
It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
times seven years; and since I could distinguish
betwixt a benefit and an injury
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen
would change my humanity with a baboon.
What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
or thus. Our bodies are our gardens
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
nettles
thyme
distract it with many
with idleness
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
reason to cool our raging motions
stings
you call love to be a sect or scion.
It cannot be.
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
the will. Come
cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
an usurped beard; I say
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
love to the Moor
his to her: it was a violent commencement
shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
that to him now is as luscious as locusts
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
change for youth: when she is sated with his body
have change
purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself
more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell
shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
to be drowned and go without her.
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes
the issue?
Thou art sure of me:--go
thee often
hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
against him: if thou canst cuckold him
thyself a pleasure
events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
Traverse! go
of this to-morrow. Adieu.
Where shall we meet i' the morning?
At my lodging.
I'll be with thee betimes.
Go to; farewell. Do you hear
What say you?
No more of drowning
I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.
Exit
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
And it is thought abroad
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
But I
The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
To get his place and to plume up my will
In double knavery--How
After some time
That he is too familiar with his wife.
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected
The Moor is of a free and open nature
As asses are.
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

ACT II
SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen
What from the cape can you discern at sea?
Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
I cannot
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea
A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
For do but stand upon the foaming shore
The wind-shaked surge
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafed flood.
If that the Turkish fleet
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd
It is impossible they bear it out.
Enter a third Gentleman
News
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
On most part of their fleet.
How! is this true?
The ship is here put in
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
But this same Cassio
Touching the Turkish loss
With foul and violent tempest.
Pray heavens he be;
For I have served him
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside
As well to see the vessel that's come in
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello
An indistinct regard.
Come
For every minute is expectancy
Of more arrivance.
Enter CASSIO
Thanks
Give him defence against the elements
Is he well shipp'd?
His bark is stoutly timber'd
Of very expert and approved allowance;
Therefore my hopes
A cry within 'A sail
Enter a fourth Gentleman
What noise?
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
Stand ranks of people
My hopes do shape him for the governor.
Guns heard
They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
Our friends at least.
I pray you
I shall.
Exit
But
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame;
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
Does tire the ingener.
Re-enter second Gentleman
How now! who has put in?
'Tis one Iago
Has had most favourable and happy speed:
Tempests themselves
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel
As having sense of beauty
Their mortal natures
The divine Desdemona.
What is she?
She that I spake of
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove
And bring all Cyprus comfort!
Enter DESDEMONA
O
Ye men of Cyprus
Hail to thee
I thank you
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
But that he's well and will be shortly here.
O
The great contention of the sea and skies
Parted our fellowship--But
Within 'A sail
They give their greeting to the citadel;
This likewise is a friend.
See for the news.
Exit Gentleman
Good ancient
To EMILIA
Welcome
Let it not gall your patience
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
Kissing her
Sir
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me
Alas
In faith
I find it still
Marry
You have little cause to say so.
Come on
O
Nay
You rise to play and go to bed to work.
You shall not write my praise.
No
What wouldst thou write of me
praise me?
O gentle lady
For I am nothing
Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?
Ay
I am not merry; but I do beguile
The thing I am
Come
I am about it; but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours
If she be fair and wise
Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
If she be black
Worse and worse.
How if fair and foolish?
She never yet was foolish that was fair;
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
her that's foul and foolish?
There's none so foul and foolish thereunto
O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed
merit
She that was ever fair and never proud
She that being anger'd
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind
To do what?
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
of him
you
counsellor?
He speaks home
the soldier than in the scholar.
[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay
her
You say true; 'tis so
these strip you out of your lieutenantry
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
oft
sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
courtesy! 'tis so
to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!
Trumpet within
The Moor! I know his trumpet.
'Tis truly so.
Let's meet him and receive him.
Lo
Enter OTHELLO and Attendants
O my fair warrior!
My dear Othello!
It gives me wonder great as my content
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
If after every tempest come such calms
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
Olympus-high and duck again as low
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate.
The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase
Amen to that
I cannot speak enough of this content;
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
And this
Kissing her
That e'er our hearts shall make!
[Aside]  O
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music
Come
News
are drown'd.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Honey
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet
In mine own comforts. I prithee
Bring thou the master to the citadel;
He is a good one
Does challenge much respect. Come
Exeunt OTHELLO
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
hither. If thou be'st valiant
men being in love have then a nobility in their
natures more than is native to them--list me. The
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guard:--first
directly in love with him.
With him! why
Lay thy finger thus
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor
and will she love him still for prating? let not
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
and what delight shall she have to look on the
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
sport
give satiety a fresh appetite
the Moor is defective in: now
required conveniences
find itself abused
instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice. Now
pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
does? a knave very voluble; no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
civil and humane seeming
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why
finder of occasions
counterfeit advantages
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides
knave is handsome
requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
hath found him already.
I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
most blessed condition.
Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
grapes: if she had been blessed
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
not mark that?
Yes
Lechery
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
together. Villanous thoughts
mutualities so marshal the way
the master and main exercise
conclusion
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
for the command
you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
some occasion to anger Cassio
too loud
other course you please
favourably minister.
Well.
Sir
may strike at you: provoke him
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
impediment most profitably removed
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
I will do this
opportunity.
I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
Adieu.
Exit
That Cassio loves her
That she loves him
The Moor
A most dear husband. Now
Not out of absolute lust
I stand accountant for as great a sin
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
Doth
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am even'd with him
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do
For his quick hunting
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
Make the Moor thank me
For making him egregiously an ass
And practising upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness. 'Tis here
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.

SCENE II. A street.
Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following
It is Othello's pleasure
general
revels his addiction leads him: for

Enter OTHELLO
Good Michael
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop
Iago hath direction what to do;
But
Will I look to't.
Iago is most honest.
Michael
Let me have speech with you.
To DESDEMONA
Come
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
Good night.
Exeunt OTHELLO
Enter IAGO
Welcome
Not this hour
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
she is sport for Jove.
She's a most exquisite lady.
And
Indeed
What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
provocation.
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
And when she speaks
She is indeed perfection.
Well
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black Othello.
Not to-night
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment.
O
you.
I have drunk but one cup to-night
craftily qualified too
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity
What
desire it.
Where are they?
Here at the door; I pray you
I'll do't; but it dislikes me.
Exit
If I can fasten but one cup upon him
As my young mistress' dog. Now
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
Three lads of Cyprus
That may offend the isle.--But here they come:
If consequence do but approve my dream
Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine
'Fore God
Good faith
a soldier.
Some wine

And let me the canakin clink
And let me the canakin clink

A life's but a span;
Why
Some wine
'Fore God
I learned it in England
most potent in potting: your Dane
your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink
to your English.
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
Why
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
gives your Hollander a vomit
can be filled.
To the health of our general!
I am for it
O sweet England!
King Stephen was a worthy peer
He held them sixpence all too dear
He was a wight of high renown
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
Some wine
Why
Will you hear't again?
No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
does those things. Well
be souls must be saved
It's true
For mine own part
any man of quality
And so do I too
Ay
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive
us our sins!--Gentlemen
Do not think
ancient; this is my right hand
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough
speak well enough.
Excellent well.
Why
Exit
To the platform
You see this fellow that is gone before;
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction: and do but see his vice;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
On some odd time of his infirmity
But is he often thus?
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
He'll watch the horologe a double set
It were well
The general were put in mind of it.
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
Enter RODERIGO
[Aside to him]  How now
I pray you
Exit RODERIGO
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
Should hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an ingraft infirmity:
It were an honest action to say
So to the Moor.
Not I
I do love Cassio well; and would do much
To cure him of this evil--But
Cry within: 'Help! help!'
Re-enter CASSIO
You rogue! you rascal!
What's the matter
A knave teach me my duty!
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
Beat me!
Dost thou prate
Striking RODERIGO
Nay
Staying him
I pray you
Let me go
Come
Drunk!

Bell rings
Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo
The town will rise: God's will
You will be shamed for ever.
Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants
What is the matter here?
'Zounds
Faints
Hold
Hold
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold
Why
Are we turn'd Turks
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
From her propriety. What is the matter
Honest Iago
I do not know: friends all but now
Devesting them for bed; and then
As if some planet had unwitted men--
Swords out
Any beginning to this peevish odds;
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
How comes it
I pray you
Worthy Montano
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.
Worthy Othello
Your officer
While I spare speech
offends me
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
By me that's said or done amiss this night;
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice
When violence assails us.
Now
And passion
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rout began
And he that is approved in this offence
'Tis monstrous. Iago
If partially affined
Touch me not so near:
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
Yet
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is
Montano and myself being in speech
And Cassio following him with determined sword
Steps in to Cassio
Myself the crying fellow did pursue
The town might fall in fright: he
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords
I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
For this was brief--I found them close together
When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report:
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him
From him that fled some strange indignity
I know
But never more be officer of mine.
Re-enter DESDEMONA
Look
I'll make thee an example.
What's the matter?
All's well now
Sir
Lead him off.
To MONTANO
Iago
Come
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO
What
Ay
Marry
Reputation
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself
As I am an honest man
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition: oft got without merit
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all
there are ways to recover the general again: you
are but now cast in his mood
policy than in malice
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
to him again
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a commander with so slight
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
spirit of wine
What was he that you followed with your sword? What
had he done to you?
I know not.
Is't possible?
I remember a mass of things
a quarrel
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains! that we should
revel and applause
Why
recovered?
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
another
Come
stands
but
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra
sensible man
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.
Come
And
I have well approved it
You or any man living may be drunk! at a time
I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
is now the general: may say so in this respect
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
her help to put you in your place again: she is of
so free
than she is requested: this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and
fortunes against any lay worth naming
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
You advise me well.
I protest
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.
You are in the right. Good night
must to the watch.
CASSIO: Good night
Exit
And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
As the free elements. And then for her
To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism
With his weak function. How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course
When devils will the blackest sins put on
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor
And by how much she strives to do him good
So will I turn her virtue into pitch
That shall enmesh them all.
Re-enter RODERIGO
How now
I do follow here in the chase
hunts
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be
have so much experience for my pains
no money at all and a little more wit
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit
And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
And thou
Though other things grow fair against the sun
Content thyself awhile. By the mass
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
Away
Nay
Exit RODERIGO
Two things are to be done:
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
I'll set her on;
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart
Soliciting his wife: ay
Dull not device by coldness and delay.

Well
If you have any music that may not be heard

does not greatly care.
We have none such
Then put up your pipes in your bag

Dost thou hear
No

of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
the general's wife be stirring
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
wilt thou do this?
She is stirring
shall seem to notify unto her.
Do
Exit Clown
Enter IAGO
In happy time
You have not been a-bed
Why
Before we parted. I have made bold
Is
Procure me some access.
I'll send her to you presently;
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way
May be more free.
I humbly thank you for't.
Exit IAGO
I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest.
Enter EMILIA
Good morrow
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it;
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again.
Yet
With Desdemona alone.
Pray you
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely.
I am much bound to you.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A room in the castle.

And by him do my duties to the senate:
That done
Repair there to me.

We'll wait upon your lordship.
Exeunt
SCENE III. The garden of the castle.
Enter DESDEMONA
Be thou assured
All my abilities in thy behalf.
Good madam
O
As friendly as you were.
Bounteous madam
I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a polite distance.
Ay
Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.
Madam
Madam
Why
Madam
Well
Exit CASSIO
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO
Ha! I like not that.
What dost thou say?
Nothing
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
Cassio
I do believe 'twas he.
How now
I have been talking with a suitor here
Who is't you mean?
Why
For if he be not one that truly loves you
I prithee
Went he hence now?
Ay
That he hath left part of his grief with me
Not now
But shall't be shortly?
The sooner
Shall't be to-night at supper?
No
To-morrow dinner
I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel.
Why
On Tuesday noon
I prithee
Exceed three days: in faith
And yet his trespass
Save that
Out of their best--is not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
Tell me
To bring him in! Trust me
Prithee
I will deny thee nothing.
Why
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves
To your own person: nay
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed
And fearful to be granted.
I will deny thee nothing:
Whereon
Shall I deny you? no: farewell
Farewell
Emilia
Whate'er you be
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul
My noble lord--
What dost thou say
Did Michael Cassio
He did
But for a satisfaction of my thought;
No further harm.
Why of thy thought
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
O
Indeed!
Indeed! ay
Is he not honest?
Honest
Honest! ay
My lord
What dost thou think?
Think
Think
By heaven
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
I heard thee say even now
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing
And didst contract and purse thy brow together
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me
My lord
I think thou dost;
And
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom
They are close delations
That passion cannot rule.
For Michael Cassio
I think so too.
Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not
Certain
Why
Nay
I prithee
The worst of words.
Good my lord
Though I am bound to every act of duty
Utter my thoughts? Why
As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
With meditations lawful?
Thou dost conspire against thy friend
A stranger to thy thoughts.
I do beseech you--
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess
To spy into abuses
Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good
What dost thou mean?
Good name in man and woman
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something
'Twas mine
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.
By heaven
You cannot
Nor shall not
Ha!
O
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
Who
But
Who dotes
O misery!
Poor and content is rich and rich enough
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven
From jealousy!
Why
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises
To say my wife is fair
Where virtue is
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
For she had eyes
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt
And on the proof
Away at once with love or jealousy!
I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit: therefore
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Wear your eye thus
I would not have your free and noble nature
I know our country disposition well;
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Is not to leave't undone
Dost thou say so?
She did deceive her father
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks
And so she did.
Why
She that
He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.
I am bound to thee for ever.
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
Not a jot
I' faith
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.
I will not.
Should you do so
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
My lord
No
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
And yet
Ay
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank
But pardon me; I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
Her will
And happily repent.
Farewell
If more thou dost perceive
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me
[Going]  My lord
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more
[Returning]  My lord
your honour
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place
Note
With any strong or vehement importunity;
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time
As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
And hold her free
Fear not my government.
I once more take my leave.
Exit
This fellow's of exceeding honesty
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have
Into the vale of years
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage
For others' uses. Yet
Prerogatived are they less than the base;
'Tis destiny unshunnable
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA
If she be false
I'll not believe't.
How now
Your dinner
By you invited
I am to blame.
Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?
I have a pain upon my forehead here.
'Faith
Let me but bind it hard
It will be well.
Your napkin is too little:
He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops
Let it alone. Come
I am very sorry that you are not well.
Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA
I am glad I have found this napkin:
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out
Heaven knows
I nothing but to please his fantasy.
Re-enter Iago
How now! what do you here alone?
Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
A thing for me? it is a common thing--
Ha!
To have a foolish wife.
O
For the same handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
Why
That which so often you did bid me steal.
Hast stol'n it from her?
No
And
Look
A good wench; give it me.
What will you do with 't
so earnest
To have me filch it?
[Snatching it]  Why
If it be not for some purpose of import
When she shall lack it.
Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
Go
Exit EMILIA
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
The Moor already changes with my poison:
Dangerous conceits are
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
Look
Re-enter OTHELLO
Not poppy
Which thou owedst yesterday.
Ha! ha! false to me?
Why
Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
Than but to know't a little.
How now
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
I saw't not
I slept the next night well
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
He that is robb'd
I am sorry to hear this.
I had been happy
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop
Farewell the neighing steed
And
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit
Is't possible
Villain
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul
Than answer my waked wrath!
Is't come to this?
Make me to see't; or
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
My noble lord
If thou dost slander her and torture me
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.
O grace! O heaven forgive me!
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note
I thank you for this profit; and from hence
I'll love no friend
Nay
I should be wise
And loses that it works for.
By the world
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof. Her name
As Dian's visage
As mine own face. If there be cords
I see
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?
Would! nay
And may: but
Would you
Behold her topp'd?
Death and damnation! O!
It were a tedious difficulty
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this
As ignorance made drunk. But yet
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
I do not like the office:
But
And
There are a kind of men so loose of soul
One of this kind is Cassio:
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona
And then
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
Over my thigh
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'
O monstrous! monstrous!
Nay
But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
'Tis a shrewd doubt
And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly.
I'll tear her all to pieces.
Nay
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
See Cassio wipe his beard with.
If it be that--
If it be that
O
One is too poor
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise
Yield up
To tyrannous hate! Swell
Yet be content.
O
Patience
Never
Ne'er feels retiring ebb
To the Propontic and the Hellespont
Swallow them up. Now
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words.
Do not rise yet.
Kneels
Witness
The execution of his wit
They rise
I greet thy love
Within these three days let me hear thee say
That Cassio's not alive.
My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
But let her live.
Damn her
Come
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
I am your own for ever.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Before the castle.
Enter DESDEMONA
Do you know
I dare not say he lies any where.
Why
He's a soldier
Go to: where lodges he?
To tell you where he lodges
Can any thing be made of this?
I know not where he lodges
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there
to lie in mine own throat.
Can you inquire him out
I will catechise the world for him; that is
questions
Seek him
moved my lord on his behalf
To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
therefore I will attempt the doing it.
Exit
Where should I lose that handkerchief
I know not
Believe me
Full of crusadoes: and
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are
To put him to ill thinking.
Is he not jealous?
Who
Drew all such humours from him.
Look
I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call'd to him.
Enter OTHELLO
How is't with you
Well
Aside
O
How do you
Well
Give me your hand: this hand is moist
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
Hot
A sequester from liberty
For here's a young and sweating devil here
You may
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
But our new heraldry is hands
I cannot speak of this. Come now
What promise
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
Lend me thy handkerchief.
Here
That which I gave you.
I have it not about me.
Not?
No
That is a fault.
That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer
The thoughts of people: she told her
she kept it
Entirely to her love
Or made gift of it
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies: she
And bid me
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose't or give't away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.
Is't possible?
'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
A sibyl
The sun to course two hundred compasses
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens' hearts.
Indeed! is't true?
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
Then would to God that I had never seen't!
Ha! wherefore?
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
Is't lost? is't gone? speak
o' the way?
Heaven bless us!
Say you?
It is not lost; but what an if it were?
How!
I say
Fetch't
Why
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.
Come
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
The handkerchief!
I pray
The handkerchief!
A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love
The handkerchief!
In sooth
Away!
Exit
Is not this man jealous?
I ne'er saw this before.
Sure
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
They are all but stomachs
To eat us hungerly
Enter CASSIO and IAGO
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
And
How now
Madam
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past
So shall I clothe me in a forced content
Alas
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him
So help me every spirit sanctified
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
Is my lord angry?
He went hence but now
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon
Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
There's matter in't indeed
I prithee
Exit IAGO
Something
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things
For let our finger ache
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain: nay
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness
Pray heaven it be state-matters
Concerning you.
Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause
Begot upon itself
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
Lady
I will go seek him. Cassio
If I do find him fit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
I humbly thank your ladyship.
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
Enter BIANCA
Save you
What make you from home?
How is it with you
I' faith
And I was going to your lodging
What
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours
O weary reckoning!
Pardon me
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
But I shall
Take me this work out.
O Cassio
This is some token from a newer friend:
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
Is't come to this? Well
Go to
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth
That this is from some mistress
No
Why
I know not
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
Take it
Leave you! wherefore?
I do attend here on the general;
And think it no addition
Why
Not that I love you not.
But that you do not love me.
I pray you
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.
Enter OTHELLO and IAGO
Will you think so?
Think so
What
An unauthorized kiss.
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more
Naked in bed
It is hypocrisy against the devil:
They that mean virtuously
So they do nothing
But if I give my wife a handkerchief
What then?
Why
She is protectress of her honour too:
May she give that?
Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
They have it very oft that have it not:
But
By heaven
Thou said'st
Ay
That's not so good now.
What
Or heard him say
But they must blab--
Hath he said any thing?
He hath
What hath he said?
'Faith
What? what?
Lie--
With her?
With her
Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her
they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
confess
hanged
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
passion without some instruction. It is not words
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses
--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--
Falls in a trance
Work on
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus
My lord
Enter CASSIO
How now
What's the matter?
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
Rub him about the temples.
No
The lethargy must have his quiet course:
If not
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
Do you withdraw yourself a little while
Exit CASSIO
How is it
Dost thou mock me?
I mock you! no
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
A horned man's a monster and a beast.
There's many a beast then in a populous city
Did he confess it?
Good sir
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
May draw with you: there's millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
O
And knowing what I am
O
Stand you awhile apart;
Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
A passion most unsuiting such a man--
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself
For I will make him tell the tale anew
He hath
I say
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen
Dost thou hear
I will be found most cunning in my patience;
But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.
That's not amiss;
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
OTHELLO retires
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
He
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
Re-enter CASSIO
As he shall smile
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Poor Cassio's smiles
The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me.
Ply Desdemona well
Speaking lower
Now
Alas
Look
I never knew woman love man so.
Alas
Now he denies it faintly
Do you hear
Now he importunes him
To tell it o'er: go to; well said
She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
Do you intend it?
Ha
Do you triumph
I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
Ha
So
'Faith
Prithee
I am a very villain else.
Have you scored me? Well.
This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
persuaded I will marry her
flattery
Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble
Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
imports it.
So hangs
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O
throw it to.
Well
Before me! look
'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
Enter BIANCA
What do you mean by this haunting of me?
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
work?--A likely piece of work
it in your chamber
This is some minx's token
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
you had it
How now
By heaven
An you'll come to supper to-night
will not
Exit
After her
'Faith
Will you sup there?
'Faith
Well
speak with you.
Prithee
Go to; say no more.
Exit CASSIO
[Advancing]  How shall I murder him
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
O Iago!
And did you see the handkerchief?
Was that mine?
Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
foolish woman your wife! she gave it him
hath given it his whore.
I would have him nine years a-killing.
A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!
Nay
Ay
for she shall not live: no
stone; I strike it
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
an emperor's side and command him tasks.
Nay
Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
and plenteous wit and invention:--
She's the worse for all this.
O
gentle a condition!
Ay
Nay
O Iago
If you are so fond over her iniquity
patent to offend; for
near nobody.
I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!
O
With mine officer!
That's fouler.
Get me some poison
expostulate with her
unprovide my mind again: this night
Do it not with poison
the bed she hath contaminated.
Good
And for Cassio
shall hear more by midnight.
Excellent good.
A trumpet within
What trumpet is that same?
Something from Venice
Come from the duke: and
Enter LODOVICO
Save you
With all my heart
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
Gives him a letter
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
Opens the letter
And what's the news
I am very glad to see you
Welcome to Cyprus.
I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
Lives
Cousin
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.
Are you sure of that?
My lord?
[Reads]  'This fail you not to do
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
A most unhappy one: I would do much
To atone them
Fire and brimstone!
My lord?
Are you wise?
What
May be the letter moved him;
For
Trust me
Indeed!
My lord?
I am glad to see you mad.
Why
[Striking her]  Devil!
I have not deserved this.
My lord
Make her amends; she weeps.
O devil
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears
Out of my sight!
I will not stay to offend you.
Going
Truly
I do beseech your lordship
Mistress!
My lord?
What would you with her
Who
Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
Sir
And she's obedient
Concerning this
I am commanded home. Get you away;
I'll send for you anon. Sir
Exit DESDEMONA
Cassio shall have my place. And
You are welcome
Exit
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
The shot of accident
He is much changed.
Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?
He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
What he might be: if what he might he is not
What
'Faith
That stroke would prove the worst!
Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood
Alas
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him
That I may save my speech: do but go after
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A room in the castle.
Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA
You have seen nothing then?
Nor ever heard
Yes
But then I saw no harm
Each syllable that breath made up between them.
What
Never
Nor send you out o' the way?
Never.
To fetch her fan
Never
That's strange.
I durst
If any wretch have put this in your head
For
Is foul as slander.
Bid her come hither: go.
Exit EMILIA
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA
My lord
Pray
What is your pleasure?
Let me see your eyes;
Look in my face.
What horrible fancy's this?
[To EMILIA]  Some of your function
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
Cough
Your mystery
Exit EMILIA
Upon my knees
I understand a fury in your words.
But not the words.
Why
Your wife
And loyal wife.
Come
Lest
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
Swear thou art honest.
Heaven doth truly know it.
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
To whom
O Desdemona! away! away! away!
Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back
Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips
A drop of patience: but
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too; well
But there
The fountain from the which my current runs
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there
Ay
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
O
That the sense aches at thee
ne'er been born!
Alas
Was this fair paper
Committed! O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth
Impudent strumpet!
By heaven
Are you not a strumpet?
No
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet
What
No
Is't possible?
O
I cry you mercy
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello.
Raising his voice
You
Re-enter EMILIA
You
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
I pray you
Exit
Alas
How do you
'Faith
Good madam
With who?
Why
Who is thy lord?
He that is yours
I have none: do not talk to me
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
And call thy husband hither.
Here's a change indeed!
Exit
'Tis meet I should be used so
How have I been behaved
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO
What is your pleasure
How is't with you?
I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
He might have chid me so; for
What's the matter
Alas
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
Am I that name
What name
Such as she says my lord did say I was.
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.
Why did he so?
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
Do not weep
Hath she forsook so many noble matches
It is my wretched fortune.
Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick upon him?
Nay
I will be hang'd
Fie
If any such there be
A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave
O heaven
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!
Speak within door.
O
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without
You are a fool; go to.
O good Iago
Good friend
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love
Or that I do not yet
And ever will--though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly
And his unkindness may defeat my life
It does abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
I pray you
The business of the state does him offence
If 'twere no other--
'Tis but so
Trumpets within
Hark
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
Go in
Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA
Enter RODERIGO
How now
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
What in the contrary?
Every day thou daffest me with some device
and rather
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
it
already I have foolishly suffered.
Will you hear me
'Faith
performances are no kin together.
You charge me most unjustly.
With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
my means. The jewels you have had from me to
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
votarist: you have told me she hath received them
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance
Well; go to; very well.
Very well! go to! I cannot go to
not very well: nay
to find myself fobbed in it.
Very well.
I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
jewels
unlawful solicitation; if not
will seek satisfaction of you.
You have said now.
Ay
Why
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
ever before. Give me thy hand
taken against me a most just exception; but yet
protest
It hath not appeared.
I grant indeed it hath not appeared
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But
have greater reason to believe now than ever
purpose
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona
engines for my life.
Well
Sir
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
Is that true? why
return again to Venice.
O
him the fair Desdemona
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
How do you mean
Why
knocking out his brains.
And that you would have me to do?
Ay
He sups to-night with a harlotry
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
fortune. If you will watch his going thence
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one
to second your attempt
us. Come
me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
him. It is now high suppertime
to waste: about it.
I will hear further reason for this.
And you shall be satisfied.
Exeunt
SCENE III. Another room In the castle.
Enter OTHELLO
I do beseech you
O
Madam
Your honour is most welcome.
Will you walk
O
My lord?
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.
I will
Exeunt OTHELLO
How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.
He says he will return incontinent:
He hath commanded me to go to bed
Dismiss me!
It was his bidding: therefore
Give me my nightly wearing
We must not now displease him.
I would you had never seen him!
"So would not I	my love doth so approve him"
Prithee
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
All's one. Good faith
If I do die before thee prithee
In one of those same sheets.
Come
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
She was in love
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
An old thing 'twas
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do
Shall I go fetch your night-gown?
No
This Lodovico is a proper man.
A very handsome man.
He speaks well.
I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree
Her hand on her bosom
The fresh streams ran by her
Sing willow
Her salt tears fell from her
Lay by these:--
Singing
Sing willow
Prithee
Singing
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve
Nay
It's the wind.
[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but what
said he then?
Sing willow
If I court moe women
So
Doth that bode weeping?
'Tis neither here nor there.
I have heard it said so. O
Dost thou in conscience think
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind?
There be some such
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
Why
No
Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
I might do't as well i' the dark.
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
For a small vice.
In troth
In troth
done. Marry
joint-ring
gowns
exhibition; but for the whole world
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.
Beshrew me
For the whole world.
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
having the world for your labour
own world
I do not think there is any such woman.
Yes
store the world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties
Why
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too: and have not we affections
Then let them use us well: else let them know
Good night
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.
Enter IAGO and RODERIGO
Here
Wear thy good rapier bare
Quick
It makes us
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
Here
Retires
I have no great devotion to the deed;
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
'Tis but a man gone. Forth
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him
It must not be: if Cassio do remain
That makes me ugly; and
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
No
Enter CASSIO
I know his gait
Makes a pass at CASSIO
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed
I will make proof of thine.
Draws
O
IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg
I am maim'd for ever. Help
Falls
Enter OTHELLO
The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.
O
It is even so.
O
'Tis he:--O brave Iago
Thou teachest me. Minion
Forth of my heart those charms
Thy bed
Exit
Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO
What
'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
O
Hark!
O wretched villain!
Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
To come in to the cry without more help.
Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
Hark!
Re-enter IAGO
Here's one comes in his shirt
Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?
We do not know.
Did not you hear a cry?
Here
What's the matter?
This is Othello's ancient
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
What are you here that cry so grievously?
Iago? O
Give me some help.
O me
I think that one of them is hereabout
O treacherous villains!
What are you there? come in
To LODOVICO and GRATIANO
O
That's one of them.
O murderous slave! O villain!
Stabs RODERIGO
O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
What may you be? are you of good or evil?
As you shall prove us
Signior Lodovico?
He
I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
Cassio!
How is't
My leg is cut in two.
Marry
Light
Enter BIANCA
What is the matter
Who is't that cried!
O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio
O notable strumpet! Cassio
Who they should be that have thus many led you?
No.
I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.
Lend me a garter. So. O
Alas
Gentlemen all
To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
Alas my friend and my dear countryman
Roderigo! no:--yes
What
Even he
Know him! ay.
Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners
I am glad to see you.
How do you
Roderigo!
He
A chair brought in
O
Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
To BIANCA
For you
here
None in the world; nor do I know the man.
[To BIANCA]  What
o' the air.
CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off
Stay you
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
Nay
Behold her well; I pray you
Do you see
Enter EMILIA
'Las
Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
He's almost slain
Alas
This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee
To BIANCA
What
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
O
Fie
I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
As you that thus abuse me.
As I! foh! fie upon thee!
Kind gentlemen
Come
Emilia run you to the citadel
Will you go on? I pray.
Aside
This is the night
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;
a light burning.
Enter OTHELLO
It is the cause
Let me not name it to you
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
Yet she must die
Put out the light
If I quench thee
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
Kissing her
Ah balmy breath
Justice to break her sword! One more
Be thus when thou art dead
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
Who's there? Othello?
Ay. Desdemona.
Will you come to bed
Have you pray'd to-night
Ay
If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace
Alas
Well
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.
Talk you of killing?
Ay
Then heaven
Have mercy on me!
Amen
If you say so
Hum!
And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not
Think on thy sins.
They are loves I bear to you.
Ay
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents; but yet I hope
Peace
I will so. What's the matter?
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
Thou gavest to Cassio.
No
Send for the man
Sweet soul
Ay
Yes
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.
Then Lord have mercy on me!
I say
And have you mercy too! I never did
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love: I never gave him token.
By heaven
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart
A murder
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then;
I never gave it him: send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.
He hath confess'd.
What
That he hath used thee.
How? unlawfully?
Ay.
He will not say so.
No
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
O! my fear interprets: what
Had all his hairs been lives
Had stomach for them all.
Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.
Out
O
Down
Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!
Nay
But half an hour!
Being done
But while I say one prayer!
It is too late.
He stifles her
[Within]  My lord
What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful;
I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So
[Within]  What
Who's there?
[Within]  O
Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--
I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?
If she come in
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
O insupportable! O heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon
Should yawn at alteration.
[Within]  I do beseech you
That I may speak with you
I had forgot thee: O
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
Unlocks the door
Enter EMILIA
What's the matter with thee now?
O
What
But now
It is the very error of the moon;
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont
Cassio
Call'd Roderigo.
Roderigo kill'd!
And Cassio kill'd!
No
Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune
O
Alas
That! what?
Out
Help! help
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress
A guiltless death I die.
O
Nobody; I myself. Farewell
Commend me to my kind lord: O
Dies
Why
Alas
You heard her say herself
She said so: I must needs report the truth.
She's
'Twas I that kill'd her.
O
She turn'd to folly
Thou dost belie her
She was false as water.
Thou art rash as fire
That she was false: O
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
O
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.
My husband!
Thy husband.
That she was false to wedlock?
Ay
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite
My husband!
Ay
An honest man he is
That sticks on filthy deeds.
My husband!
What needs this iteration
O mistress
He
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
My friend
If he say so
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
Ha!
Do thy worst:
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her.
Peace
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!
Enter MONTANO
What is the matter? How now
O
What is the matter?
Disprove this villain
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
I know thou didst not
Speak
I told him what I thought
Than what he found himself was apt and true.
But did you ever tell him she was false?
I did.
You told a lie
Upon my soul
She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?
With Cassio
I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed
O heavens forfend!
And your reports have set the murder on.
Nay
'Tis a strange truth.
O monstrous act!
Villany
I think upon't
I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
O villany
What
Good gentlemen
'Tis proper I obey him
Perchance
O! O! O!
He falls on the bed
Nay
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
That e'er did lift up eye.
[Rising]  O
I scarce did know you
I know this act shows horrible and grim.
Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:
Thy match was mortal to him
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now
'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that recognizance and pledge of love
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
It was a handkerchief
My father gave my mother.
O heaven! O heavenly powers!
Come
'Twill out
No
Let heaven and men and devils
Be wise
I will not.
IAGO offers to stab EMILIA
Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?
O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
I found by fortune and did give my husband;
For often
Villanous whore!
She give it Cassio! no
Filth
By heaven
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
Do with so good a woman?
Are there no stones in heaven
But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!
He runs at IAGO  IAGO
The woman falls; sure
Ay
He's gone
'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon
Come
Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO
I am not valiant neither
But why should honour outlive honesty?
Let it go all.
What did thy song bode
Hark
And die in music.
Singing
Willow
Moor
So come my soul to bliss
So speaking as I think
Dies
I have another weapon in this chamber;
It is a sword of Spain
O
[Within]  If thou attempt it
Thou hast no weapon
Look in upon me then and speak with me
Re-enter GRATIANO
What is the matter?
Behold
A better never did itself sustain
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day
Than twenty times your stop: but
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
Be not afraid
Here is my journey's end
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
Man but a rush against Othello's breast
Now
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
Whip me
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
That's he that was Othello: here I am.
Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
If that thou best a devil
Wounds IAGO
Wrench his sword from him.
I bleed
I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
For
O thou Othello
Why
An honourable murderer
For nought I did in hate
This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?
Ay.
Dear general
I do believe it
Will you
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
Demand me nothing: what you know
From this time forth I never will speak word.
What
Torments will ope your lips.
Well
Sir
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
And here another: the one of them imports
The death of Cassio to be undertook
By Roderigo.
O villain!
Most heathenish and most gross!
Now here's another discontented paper
But that belike Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him.
O the pernicious caitiff!
How came you
That was my wife's?
I found it in my chamber:
And he himself confess'd but even now
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
Which wrought to his desire.
O fool! fool! fool!
There is besides in Roderigo's letter
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
That I was cast: and even but now he spake
You must forsake this room
Your power and your command is taken off
That can torment him much and hold him long
To the Venetian state. Come
Soft you; a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service
No more of that. I pray you
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
Of one not easily jealous
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
And say besides
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state
Stabs himself
O bloody period!
All that's spoke is marr'd.
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
Killing myself
Falls on the bed
This did I fear
For he was great of heart.
[To IAGO]  O Spartan dog
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;
Let it be hid. Gratiano
The time
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

ACT I
PROLOGUE
Enter GOWER
Before the palace of Antioch
To sing a song that old was sung
Assuming man's infirmities
It hath been sung at festivals
And lords and ladies in their lives
Have read it for restoratives:
The purchase is to make men glorious;
Et bonum quo antiquius
If you
And that to hear an old man sing
May to your wishes pleasure bring
I life would wish
Waste it for you
This Antioch
Built up
The fairest in all Syria
This king unto him took a fere
With whom the father liking took
Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
To evil should be done by none:
But custom what they did begin
Was with long use account no sin.
The beauty of this sinful dame
Made many princes thither frame
Which to prevent he made a law
So for her many a wight did die
What now ensues
I give
Exit
SCENE I. Antioch. A room in the palace.
Enter ANTIOCHUS
Young prince of Tyre
The danger of the task you undertake.
I have
Embolden'd with the glory of her praise
Bring in our daughter
At whose conception
Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
See where she comes
Of every virtue gives renown to men!
Her face the book of praises
Nothing but curious pleasures
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
Could never be her mild companion.
You gods that made me man
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree
Prince Pericles
That would be son to great Antiochus.
Before thee stands this fair Hesperides
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
Her face
Her countless glory
And which
Presumes to reach
Yon sometimes famous princes
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
For going on death's net
Antiochus
My frail mortality to know itself
This body
For death remember'd should be like a mirror
I'll make my will then
Who know the world
So I bequeath a happy peace to you
And all good men
My riches to the earth from whence they came;
But my unspotted fire of love to you.
To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
Thus ready for the way of life or death
Scorning advice
Which read and not expounded
Of all say'd yet
Of all say'd yet
Like a bold champion
But faithfulness and courage.
He reads the riddle
I am no viper
On mother's flesh which did me breed.
I sought a husband
I found that kindness in a father:
He's father
I mother
How they may be
Sharp physic is the last: but
That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts
Fair glass of light
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:
But I must tell you
For he's no man on whom perfections wait
That
You are a fair viol
Who
But being play'd upon before your time
Good sooth
Prince Pericles
For that's an article within our law
Either expound now
Great king
'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
Who has a book of all that monarchs do
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
Blows dust in other's eyes
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
Copp'd hills towards heaven
By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.
Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's
their will;
And if Jove stray
It is enough you know; and it is fit
All love the womb that their first being bred

But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre
Yet hope
As your fair self
Forty days longer we do respite you;
If by which time our secret be undone
And until then your entertain shall be
As doth befit our honour and your worth.
Exeunt all but PERICLES
How courtesy would seem to cover sin
If it be true that I interpret false
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
Where now you're both a father and a son
And she an eater of her mother's flesh
And both like serpents are
On sweetest flowers
Antioch
Blush not in actions blacker than the night
One sin
Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:
Poison and treason are the hands of sin
Then
Exit
Re-enter ANTIOCHUS
He hath found the meaning
To have his head.
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy
In such a loathed manner;
And therefore instantly this prince must die:
For by his fall my honour must keep high.
Who attends us there?
Enter THALIARD
Doth your highness call?
Thaliard
Her private actions to your secrecy;
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
Thaliard
We hate the prince of Tyre
It fits thee not to ask the reason why
My lord
Enough.
Enter a Messenger
Let your breath cool yourself
My lord
Exit
As thou
Wilt live
From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
His eye doth level at
Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'

SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.
Enter PERICLES
[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.--Why should
this change of thoughts
Here pleasures court mine eyes
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind
And what was first but fear what might be done
And so with me: the great Antiochus
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
If he suspect I may dishonour him:
And what may make him blush in being known
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land
Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist
Which care of them
Enter HELICANUS
Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!
And keep your mind
Peace
They do abuse the king that flatter him:
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
The thing which is flatter'd
Whereas reproof
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace
Prince
I cannot be much lower than my knees.
All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook
What shipping and what lading's in our haven
Exeunt Lords
Helicanus
Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?
An angry brow
If there be such a dart in princes' frowns
How dare the plants look up to heaven
They have their nourishment?
Thou know'st I have power
To take thy life from thee.
[Kneeling]
I have ground the axe myself;
Do you but strike the blow.
Rise
Sit down: thou art no flatterer:
I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
That kings should let their ears hear their
faults hid!
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince
To bear with patience
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
Thou speak'st like a physician
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
Attend me
From whence an issue I might propagate
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
Which by my knowledge found
Seem'd not to strike
know'st this
Such fear so grew in me
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
Decrease not
And should he doubt it
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed
When all
Which love to all
Alas
Drew sleep out of mine eyes
How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
And finding little comfort to relieve them
Well
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear
Will take away your life.
Therefore
Your rule direct to any; if to me.
Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.
I do not doubt thy faith;
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?
We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth
Tyre
Intend my travel
And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
The care I had and have of subjects' good
On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
I'll take thy word for faith
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:
But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe
Exeunt
SCENE III. Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.
Enter THALIARD
So
kill King Pericles; and if I do it not
be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well
he was a wise fellow
he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he
had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a
villain
be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.
Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES
You shall not need
His seal'd commission
[Aside]  How! the king gone!
If further yet you will be satisfied
Being at Antioch--
[Aside]          What from Antioch?
Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--
Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:
And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd
So puts himself unto the shipman's toil
[Aside]  Well
I shall not be hang'd now
But since he's gone
He 'scaped the land
I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!
Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
From him I come
With message unto princely Pericles;
But since my landing I have understood
Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels
We have no reason to desire it
Yet
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.
Enter CLEON
My Dionyza
That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
For who digs hills because they do aspire
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
O my distressed lord
Here they're but felt
O Dionyza
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep
That
I'll then discourse our woes
I'll do my best
This Tarsus
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd
Their tables were stored full
All poverty was scorn'd
O
But see what heaven can do! By this our change
Those palates who
Those mothers who
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
So sharp are hunger's teeth
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
Here stands a lord
Here many sink
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
Is not this true?
Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
O
And her prosperities so largely taste
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
Enter a Lord
Where's the lord governor?
Here.
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste
We have descried
I thought as much.
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir
And so in ours: some neighbouring nation
And make a conquest of unhappy me
That's the least fear; for
Of their white flags display'd
Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
But bring they what they will and what they can
The ground's the lowest
Go tell their general we attend him here
I go
Exit
Welcome is peace
If wars
Enter PERICLES with Attendants
Lord governor
Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre
Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears
And these our ships
Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
With bloody veins
The gods of Greece protect you!
And we'll pray for you.
Arise
We do not look for reverence
The which when any shall not gratify
Till when
Your grace is welcome to our town and us.
Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile

Enter GOWER
Here have you seen a mighty king
His child
A better prince and benign lord
Be quiet then as men should be
I'll show you those in troubles reign
The good in conversation
Thinks all is writ he speken can;
And
But tidings to the contrary
Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?
DUMB SHOW.
Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all  the train with them. Enter at another door a  Gentleman
Good Helicane
From others' labours; for though he strive
To killen bad
And to fulfil his prince' desire
How Thaliard came full bent with sin
And had intent to murder him;
And that in Tarsus was not best
Longer for him to make his rest.
He
For now the wind begins to blow;
Thunder above and deeps below
Make such unquiet
Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;

Exit
SCENE I. Pentapolis. An open place by the sea-side.
Enter PERICLES
Yet cease your ire
Wind
Is but a substance that must yield to you;
And I
Alas
Nothing to think on but ensuing death:
Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;
And having thrown him from your watery grave
Enter three FISHERMEN
What
Ha
What
What say you
Look how thou stirrest now! come away
fetch thee with a wanion.
Faith
were cast away before us even now.
Alas
pitiful cries they made to us to help them
Nay
porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say
they're half fish
marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
Why
little ones: I can compare our rich misers to
nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and
tumbles
last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales
have I heard on o' the land
till they've swallowed the whole parish
[Aside]  A pretty moral.
But
been that day in the belfry.
Why
Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I
had been in his belly
jangling of the bells
left
parish up again. But if the good King Simonides
were of my mind
[Aside]  Simonides!
We would purge the land of these drones
the bee of her honey.
[Aside]  How from the finny subject of the sea
These fishers tell the infirmities of men;
And from their watery empire recollect
All that may men approve or men detect!
Peace be at your labour
Honest! good fellow
fits you
look after it.
May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.
What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
way!
A man whom both the waters and the wind
For them to play upon
He asks of you
No
country Greece gets more with begging than we can do
with working.
Canst thou catch any fishes
I never practised it.
Nay
to be got now-a-days
What I have been I have forgot to know;
But what I am
A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill
To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;
Which if you shall refuse
Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;
come
handsome fellow! Come
we'll have flesh for holidays
fasting-days
I thank you
Hark you
I did but crave.
But crave! Then I'll turn craver too
shall 'scape whipping.
Why
O
beggars were whipped
than to be beadle. But
net.
Exit with Third Fisherman
[Aside]  How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!
Hark you
Not well.
Why
our king the good Simonides.
The good King Simonides
Ay
peaceable reign and good government.
He is a happy king
the name of good by his government. How far is his
court distant from this shore?
Marry
you
birth-day; and there are princes and knights come
from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.
Were my fortunes equal to my desires
to make one there.
O

Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen
Help

'tis turned to a rusty armour.
An armour
Thanks
And though it was mine own
With this strict charge
Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--
'For that it saved me
The which the gods protect thee from!--may
defend thee.'
It kept where I kept
Till the rough seas
I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill
What mean you
To beg of you
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly
And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court
And if that ever my low fortune's better
Why
I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.
Why
Ay
this garment through the rough seams of the waters:
there are certain condolements
hope
whence you had it.
Believe 't
By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;
And
Unto thy value I will mount myself
Upon a courser
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
Only
Of a pair of bases.
We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to
make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.
Then honour be but a goal to my will

SCENE II. The same. A public way or platform leading to the
lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the
reception of King
Enter SIMONIDES
Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?
They are
And stay your coming to present themselves.
Return them
For men to see
Exit a Lord
It pleaseth you
My commendations great
It's fit it should be so; for princes are
A model which heaven makes like to itself:
As jewels lose their glory if neglected
'Tis now your honour
The labour of each knight in his device.
Which
Enter a Knight; he passes over
Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
A knight of Sparta
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
The word
He loves you well that holds his life of you.
The Second Knight passes over
Who is the second that presents himself?
A prince of Macedon
And the device he bears upon his shield
Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
The motto thus
The Third Knight passes over
And what's the third?
The third of Antioch;
And his device
The word
The Fourth Knight passes over
What is the fourth?
A burning torch that's turned upside down;
The word
Which shows that beauty hath his power and will
The Fifth Knight passes over
The fifth
The motto thus
The Sixth Knight
And what's
The sixth and last
With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?
He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
A wither'd branch
The motto
A pretty moral;
From the dejected state wherein he is
He had need mean better than his outward show
Can any way speak in his just commend;
For by his rusty outside he appears
To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.
He well may be a stranger
To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.
And on set purpose let his armour rust
Until this day
Opinion's but a fool
The outward habit by the inward man.
But stay
Into the gallery.
Exeunt
Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!'
SCENE III. The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.
Enter SIMONIDES
Knights
To place upon the volume of your deeds
Prepare for mirth
You are princes and my guests.
But you
To whom this wreath of victory I give
'Tis more by fortune
Call it by what you will
And here
In framing an artist
And you are her labour'd scholar. Come
the feast
For
Marshal the rest
We are honour'd much by good Simonides.
Your presence glads our days: honour we love;
For who hates honour hates the gods above.
Sir
Some other is more fit.
Contend not
That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
Envy the great nor do the low despise.
You are right courteous knights.
Sit
By Jove
By Juno
Wishing him my meat. Sure
He's but a country gentleman;
Has done no more than other knights have done;
Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.
To me he seems like diamond to glass.
Yon king's to me like to my father's picture
Had princes sit
None that beheld him
Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night
Whereby I see that Time's the king of men
What
Who can be other in this royal presence?
Here
As you do love
We drink this health to you.
We thank your grace.
Yet pause awhile:
Yon knight doth sit too melancholy
Had not a show might countervail his worth.
Note it not you
What is it
To me
O
Princes in this should live like gods above
To honour them:
And princes not doin g so are like to gnats
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet
Alas
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
He may my proffer take for an offence
How!
Do as I bid you
[Aside]  Now
And furthermore tell him
The king my father
I thank him.
Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
I thank both him and you
And further he desires to know of you
A gentleman of Tyre; my name
My education been in arts and arms;
Who
He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles
Bereft of ships and men
Now
Come
Even in your armours
I will not have excuse
Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads
The Knights dance
So
Come
Here is a lady that wants breathing too:
And I have heard
Are excellent in making ladies trip;
And that their measures are as excellent.
In those that practise them they are
O
Of your fair courtesy.
The Knights and Ladies dance
Unclasp
Thanks
To PERICLES
But you the best. Pages and lights
These knights unto their several lodgings!
To PERICLES
Yours
I am at your grace's pleasure.
Princes
And that's the mark I know you level at:
Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
To-morrow all for speeding do their best.

Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES
No
For which
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store
Of an inestimable value
Their bodies
Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
'Twas very strange.
And yet but justice; for though
This king were great
To bar heaven's shaft
'Tis very true.
Enter two or three Lords
See
Or council has respect with him but he.
It shall no longer grieve without reproof.
And cursed be he that will not second it.
Follow me
With me? and welcome: happy day
Know that our griefs are risen to the top
Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.
Wrong not yourself
But if the prince do live
If in the world he live
If in his grave he rest
And be resolved he lives to govern us
Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:
And knowing this kingdom is without a head
Like goodly buildings left without a roof
Soon fall to ruin
Live
For honour's cause
If that you love Prince Pericles
Take I your wish
A twelvemonth longer
Forbear the absence of your king:
If in which time expired
But if I cannot win you to this love
Whom if you find
To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;
And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us
Then you love us
When peers thus knit
Exeunt
SCENE V. Pentapolis. A room in the palace.
Enter SIMONIDES
Good morrow to the good Simonides.
Knights
A married life.
Her reason to herself is only known
May we not get access to her
'Faith
Her to her chamber
One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd
And on her virgin honour will not break it.
Loath to bid farewell
Exeunt Knights
So
She tells me here
'Tis well
I like that well: nay
Well
And will no longer have it be delay'd.
Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.
Enter PERICLES
All fortune to the good Simonides!
To you as much
For your sweet music this last night: I do
Protest my ears were never better fed
With such delightful pleasing harmony.
It is your grace's pleasure to commend;
Not my desert.
Sir
The worst of all her scholars
Let me ask you one thing:
What do you think of my daughter
A most virtuous princess.
And she is fair too
As a fair day in summer
Sir
Ay
I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.
She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.
[Aside]  What's here?
A letter
'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.
O
Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter
A villain.
By the gods
Never did thought of mine levy offence;
Nor never did my actions yet commence
A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.
Traitor
Traitor!
Ay
Even in his throat--unless it be the king--
That calls me traitor
[Aside]  Now
My actions are as noble as my thoughts
I came unto your court for honour's cause
And he that otherwise accounts of me
No?
Here comes my daughter
Enter THAISA
Then
Did ere solicit
To any syllable that made love to you.
Why
Yea
Aside
I am glad on't with all my heart.--
I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.
Will you
Upon a stranger?
Aside
who
Therefore hear you
Your will to mine
Man and wife:
Nay
And being join'd
And for a further grief
What
Yes
Even as my life
What
Yes
It pleaseth me so well
And then with what haste you can get you to bed.

ACT III
Enter GOWER
Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;
No din but snores the house about
Of this most pompous marriage-feast.

And crickets sing at the oven's mouth
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.

With your fine fancies quaintly eche:
What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
DUMB SHOW.
Enter
By many a dern and painful perch
Of Pericles the careful search
Which the world together joins
That horse and sail and high expense
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre
Are letters brought
Antiochus and his daughter dead;
The men of Tyrus on the head
Of Helicanus would set on
The crown of Tyre
The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
Says to 'em
Come not home in twice six moons
Who dream'd
Brief
His queen with child makes her desire--
Which who shall cross?--along to go:
Omit we all their dole and woe:
Lychorida
On Neptune's billow; half the flood
Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
Varies again; the grisly north
Disgorges such a tempest forth
The lady shrieks
Does fall in travail with her fear:
And what ensues in this fell storm
Shall for itself itself perform.
I nill relate
Conveniently the rest convey;
Which might not what by me is told.
In your imagination hold
This stage the ship
The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.

Thou god of this great vast
Upon the winds command
Thy deafening
Thy nimble
Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle

Divinest patroness
To those that cry by night
Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs
Of my queen's travails!
Enter LYCHORIDA
Now
Here is a thing too young for such a place
Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
Of your dead queen.
How
Patience
Here's all that is left living of your queen
O you gods!
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts
Recall not what we give
Use honour with you.
Patience
Now
For a more blustrous birth had never babe:
Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!
Thou hast as chiding a nativity
As fire
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit
Throw their best eyes upon't!
Enter two Sailors
What courage
Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;
It hath done to me the worst. Yet
Of this poor infant
Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not
Blow
But sea-room
the moon
Sir
cleared of the dead.
That's your superstition.
Pardon us
observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore
briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.
As you think meet. Most wretched queen!
Here she lies
A terrible childbed hast thou had
No light
Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time
To give thee hallow'd to thy grave
Must cast thee
Where
And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse
Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
Upon the pillow: hie thee
A priestly farewell to her: suddenly
Exit LYCHORIDA
Sir
and bitumed ready.
I thank thee. Mariner
We are near Tarsus.
Thither
Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?
By break of day
O
There will I visit Cleon
Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it
At careful nursing. Go thy ways
I'll bring the body presently.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.
Enter CERIMON
Philemon
Enter PHILEMON
Doth my lord call?
Get fire and meat for these poor men:
'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.
I have been in many; but such a night as this
Your master will be dead ere you return;
There's nothing can be minister'd to nature
That can recover him.
To PHILEMON
Give this to the 'pothecary
Exeunt all but CERIMON
Enter two Gentlemen
Good morrow.
Good morrow to your lordship.
Gentlemen
Sir
The very principals did seem to rend
Made me to quit the house.
That is the cause we trouble you so early;
'Tis not our husbandry.
O
But I much marvel that your lordship
Rich tire about you
Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
'Tis most strange
I hold it ever
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
May the two latter darken and expend;
But immortality attends the former.
Making a man a god. 'Tis known
Have studied physic
To me and to my aid the blest infusions
That dwell in vegetives
And I can speak of the disturbances
That nature works
A more content in course of true delight
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour
Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
Your charity
Your creatures
And not your knowledge
Your purse
Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.
Enter two or three Servants with a chest
So; lift there.
What is that?
Sir
Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:
'Tis of some wreck.
Set 't down
'Tis like a coffin
Whate'er it be
If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold
'Tis so
How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
Did the sea cast it up?
I never saw so huge a billow
Wrench it open;
Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.
A delicate odour.
As ever hit my nostril. So
O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
Most strange!
Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured
With full bags of spices! A passport too!
Apollo
Reads from a scroll
'Here I give to understand
This queen
Who finds her
She was the daughter of a king:
Besides this treasure for a fee
If thou livest
That even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.
Most likely
Nay
For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:
Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.
Exit a Servant
Death may usurp on nature many hours
The o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an Egyptian
That had nine hours lien dead
Re-enter a Servant
Well said
The rough and woeful music that we have
The viol once more: how thou stirr'st
The music there!--I pray you
Gentlemen.
This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth
Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced
Above five hours: see how she gins to blow
Into life's flower again!
The heavens
Your fame forever.
She is alive; behold
Which Pericles hath lost
The diamonds of a most praised water
Do appear
She moves
O dear Diana
Is not this strange?
Most rare.
Hush
Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.
Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to
And AEsculapius guide us!
Exeunt
SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.
Enter PERICLES
Most honour'd Cleon
My twelve months are expired
In a litigious peace. You
Make up the rest upon you!
Your shafts of fortune
O your sweet queen!
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither
We cannot but obey
The powers above us. Could I rage and roar
As doth the sea she lies in
Must be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina
I charge your charity withal
The infant of your care; beseeching you
To give her princely training
Manner'd as she is born.
Fear not
Your grace
Should therein make me vile
But if to that my nature need a spur
I believe you;
Your honour and your goodness teach me to't
Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain
Good madam
In bringing up my child.
I have one myself
Than yours
Madam
We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore
The gentlest winds of heaven.
I will embrace
Your offer. Come
Look to your little mistress
You may depend hereafter. Come
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.
Enter CERIMON and THAISA
Madam
At your command. Know you the character?
It is my lord's.
That I was shipp'd at sea
Deliver'd
Madam
Moreover
Shall there attend you.
My recompense is thanks
Yet my good will is great
Exeunt
ACT IV
Enter GOWER
Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus
Now to Marina bend your mind
At Tarsus
In music
Of education all the grace
Of general wonder. But
Of earned praise
Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
And in this kind hath our Cleon
One daughter
Hight Philoten: and it is said
For certain in our story
Would ever with Marina be:
Be't when she weaved the sleided silk
With fingers long
Or when she would with sharp needle wound
The cambric
By hurting it; or when to the lute
She sung
She would with rich and constant pen
Vail to her mistress Dian; still
This Philoten contends in skill
With absolute Marina: so
With the dove of Paphos might the crow
Vie feathers white. Marina gets
All praises
In Philoten all graceful marks
For good Marina
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead
And cursed Dionyza hath
The pregnant instrument of wrath
Prest for this blow. The unborn event
I do commend to your content:
Only I carry winged time
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;
Which never could I so convey
Dionyza does appear
Exit
SCENE I. Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.
Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE
Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
'Tis but a blow
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon
Even women have cast off
A soldier to thy purpose.
I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.
The fitter
she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
Thou art resolved?
I am resolved.
Enter MARINA
No
How now
How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
A nurse of me. Lord
With this unprofitable woe!
Come
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there
No
I'll not bereave you of your servant.
Come
I love the king your father
Expect him here: when he shall come and find
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted
Blame both my lord and me
No care to your best courses. Go
That excellent complexion
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me
I can go home alone.
Well
But yet I have no desire to it.
Come
Walk half an hour
Remember what I have said.
I warrant you
I'll leave you
Pray
What! I must have a care of you.
My thanks
Exit DIONYZA
Is this wind westerly that blows?
South-west.
When I was born
Was't so?
My father
His kingly hands
And
That almost burst the deck.
When was this?
When I was born:
Never was waves nor wind more violent;
And from the ladder-tackle washes off
A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one
And with a dropping industry they skip
From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles
The master calls
Come
What mean you?
If you require a little space for prayer
To do my work with haste.
Why will you kill me?
To satisfy my lady.
Why would she have me kill'd?
Now
I never spake bad word
To any living creature: believe me
I trod upon a worm against my will
My commission
Is not to reason of the deed
You will not do't for all the world
You are well favour'd
You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately
Good sooth
Your lady seeks my life; come you between
I am sworn
He seizes her
Enter Pirates
Hold
LEONINE runs away
A prize! a prize!
Half-part
Come
Exeunt Pirates with MARINA
Re-enter LEONINE
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;
And they have seized Marina. Let her go:
There's no hope she will return. I'll swear
she's dead
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her
Exit
SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.
Enter Pandar
Boult!
Sir?
Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of
gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
too wenchless.
We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
poor three
do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.
Therefore let's have fresh ones
them. If there be not a conscience to be used in
every trade
Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor
bastards
Ay
shall I search the market?
What else
will blow it to pieces
Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome
conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead
lay with the little baggage.
Ay
for worms. But I'll go search the market.
Exit
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a
proportion to live quietly
Why to give over
when we are old?
O
the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore
estate
Besides
will be strong with us for giving over.
Come
As well as we! ay
Neither is our profession any trade; it's no
calling. But here comes Boult.
Re-enter BOULT
[To MARINA]  Come your ways. My masters
she's a virgin?
O
Master
if you like her
Boult
She has a good face
good clothes: there's no further necessity of
qualities can make her be refused.
What's her price
I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
Well
money presently. Wife

Exeunt Pandar and Pirates
Boult

have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap
thing
as I command you.
Performance shall follow.
Exit
Alack that Leonine was so slack
He should have struck
For to seek my mother!
Why lament you
That I am pretty.
Come
I accuse them not.
You are light into my hands
The more my fault
To scape his hands where I was like to die.
Ay
No.
Yes
fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the
difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?
Are you a woman?
What would you have me be
An honest woman
Marry
something to do with you. Come
foolish sapling
you.
The gods defend me!
If it please the gods to defend you by men
must comfort you
you up. Boult's returned.
Re-enter BOULT
Now
I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;
I have drawn her picture with my voice.
And I prithee tell me
inclination of the people
'Faith
hearkened to their father's testament. There was a
Spaniard's mouth so watered
her very description.
We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.
To-night

Who
Ay
proclamation; but he made a groan at it
he would see her to-morrow.
Well
hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will
come in our shadow
sun.
Well
should lodge them with this sign.
[To MARINA]  Pray you
have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must
seem to do that fearfully which you commit
willingly
To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good
opinion
I understand you not.
O
blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.
Thou sayest true
bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
with warrant.
'Faith
I have bargained for the joint
Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
I may so.
Who should deny it? Come
manner of your garments well.
Ay
Boult
sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.
When nature flamed this piece
turn; therefore say what a paragon she is
hast the harvest out of thine own report.
I warrant you
the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
Come your ways; follow me.
If fires be hot
Diana
What have we to do with Diana? Pray you
Exeunt
SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.
Enter CLEON and DIONYZA
Why
O Dionyza
The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!
I think
You'll turn a child again.
Were I chief lord of all this spacious world
To equal any single crown o' the earth
I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
Whom thou hast poison'd too:
If thou hadst drunk to him
Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates
She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
Unless you play the pious innocent
'She died by foul play.'
O
Do like this worst.
Be one of those that think
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence
To think of what a noble strain you are
To such proceeding
Who ever but his approbation added
From honourable sources.
Be it so
Yet none does know
She did disdain my child
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
And though you call my course unnatural
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
Perform'd to your sole daughter.
Heavens forgive it!
And as for Pericles
Is almost finish'd
In glittering golden characters express
A general praise to her
At whose expense 'tis done.
Thou art like the harpy
You are like one that superstitiously
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:
But yet I know you'll do as I advise.
Exeunt
SCENE IV:
Enter GOWER
Thus time we waste
Sail seas in cockles
Making
By you being pardon'd
To use one language in each several clime
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
To learn of me
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas
To see his daughter
Old Escanes
Advanced in time to great and high estate
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
This king to Tarsus
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on
To fetch his daughter home
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.
DUMB SHOW.
Enter PERICLES
See how belief may suffer by foul show!
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
And Pericles
o'ershower'd
Never to wash his face
He puts on sackcloth
A tempest
The epitaph is for Marina writ
By wicked Dionyza.
Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument
'The fairest
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth
Therefore the earth
Wherefore she does
No visor does become black villany
So well as soft and tender flattery.
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
In her unholy service. Patience

No

But to have divinity preached there! did you ever

I am glad to see your honour in good health.
You may so; 'tis the better for you that your

withal
We have here one

If she'ld do the deed of darkness

Why
I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.
How long have you been of this profession?
E'er since I can remember.
Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at
five or at seven?
Earlier too
Why

Do you know this house to be a place of such resort

That thought you worthy of it.
How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.
For me
Have placed me in this sty
Would set me free from this unhallow'd place
That flies i' the purer air!
I did not think
Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind
Persever in that clear way thou goest
The good gods preserve you!
For me
That I came with no ill intent; for to me
The very doors and windows savour vilely.
Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue
I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.

Exit
Come
Whither wilt thou have me?
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
Prithee
Come now
What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
Why
Neither of these are so bad as thou art
Thou hold'st a place
Of hell would not in reputation change:
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;
To the choleric fisting of every rogue
Thy ear is liable; thy food is such
As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
What would you have me do? go to the wars
you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss
of a leg
buy him a wooden one?
Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
OLD receptacles
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:
Any of these ways are yet better than this;
For what thou professest
Would safely deliver me from this place!
Here
If that thy master would gain by thee
And I will undertake all these to teach.
I doubt not but this populous city will
Yield many scholars.
But can you teach all this you speak of?
Prove that I cannot
That doth frequent your house.
Well

But amongst honest women.

But since my master and mistress have bought you
will make them acquainted with your purpose
doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.

ACT V
Enter GOWER
Marina thus the brothel 'scapes
Into an honest house
She sings like one immortal
As goddess-like to her admired lays;
Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes
Nature's own shape
Her inkle
That pupils lacks she none of noble race
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
And to her father turn our thoughts again
Whence
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies
And to him in his barge with fervor hies.

Enter two Sailors
[To the Sailor of Mytilene]  Where is lord Helicanus?
he can resolve you.
O
Sir
That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.
Ho
Enter two or three Gentlemen
Doth your lordship call?
Gentlemen
I pray ye
The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend
Enter
Sir
Hail
And you
You wish me well.
Being on shore
First
I am the governor of this place you lie before.
Sir
A man who for this three months hath not spoken
To any one
But to prorogue his grief.
Upon what ground is his distemperature?
'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
But the main grief springs from the loss
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.
May we not see him?
You may;
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.
Yet let me obtain my wish.
Behold him.
PERICLES discovered
This was a goodly person
Sir king
Hail
It is in vain; he will not speak to you.
Sir
'Tis well bethought.
She questionless with her sweet harmony
And other chosen attractions
She is all happy as the fairest of all
The leafy shelter that abuts against
The island's side.
Whispers a Lord
Sure
That bears recovery's name. But
We have stretch'd thus far
That for our gold we may provision have
O
Which if we should deny
For every graff would send a caterpillar
Let me entreat to know at large the cause
Of your king's sorrow.
Sit
But
Re-enter
O
The lady that I sent for. Welcome
Is't not a goodly presence?
She's a gallant lady.
She's such a one
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock
Fair one
Expect even here
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught
As thy desires can wish.
Sir
My utmost skill in his recovery
That none but I and my companion maid
Be suffer'd to come near him.
Come
And the gods make her prosperous!
MARINA sings
Mark'd he your music?
No
See
Hail
Hum
I am a maid
Might equal yours
Though wayward fortune did malign my state
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
But time hath rooted out my parentage
Bound me in servitude.
Aside
I will desist;
But there is something glows upon my cheek
My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?
I said
I do think so. Pray you
You are like something that--What country-woman?
Here of these shores?
No
Yet I was mortally brought forth
No other than I appear.
I am great with woe
My dearest wife was like this maid
My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;
Who starves the ears she feeds
Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
You may discern the place.
Where were you bred?
And how achieved you these endowments
You make more rich to owe?
If I should tell my history
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.
Prithee
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
Modest as Justice
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
believe thee
To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
Didst thou not say
Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
From good descending?
So indeed I did.
Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury
Some such thing
I said
Did warrant me was likely.
Tell thy story;
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
Of my endurance
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
How lost thou them? Thy name
Recount
My name is Marina.
O
To make the world to laugh at me.
Patience
Nay
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me
The name
Was given me by one that had some power
How! a king's daughter?
And call'd Marina?
You said you would believe me;
But
But are you flesh and blood?
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?
And wherefore call'd Marina?
Call'd Marina
For I was born at sea.
At sea! what mother?
My mother was the daughter of a king;
Who died the minute I was born
Deliver'd weeping.
O
Aside
This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
I'll hear you more
You scorn: believe me
I will believe you by the syllable
Of what you shall deliver. Yet
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
Till cruel Cleon
A villain to attempt it
Brought me to Mytilene. But
It may be
I am the daughter to King Pericles
Ho
Calls my lord?
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor
I know not; but
Here is the regent
Speaks nobly of her.
She would never tell
Her parentage; being demanded that
O Helicanus
Give me a gash
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
O'erbear the shores of my mortality
Thou that wast born at sea
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that
First
I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
My drown'd queen's name
Thou hast been godlike perfect
To Pericles thy father.
Is it no more to be your daughter than
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
Thaisa was my mother
The minute I began.
Now
Give me fresh garments. Mine own
She is not dead at Tarsus
When thou shalt kneel
She is thy very princess. Who is this?
Sir
I embrace you.
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
O heavens bless my girl! But
Tell Helicanus
O'er
My lord
None!
The music of the spheres! List
It is not good to cross him; give him way.
Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?
My lord
Music
Most heavenly music!
It nips me unto listening
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.
Sleeps
A pillow for his head:
So
Exeunt all but PERICLES
DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision
My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither
There
To mourn thy crosses
And give them repetition to the life.
Or perform my bidding
Do it
Awake
Disappears

Re-enter HELICANUS
Sir?
My purpose was for Tarsus
The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
For other service first: toward Ephesus
Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.
To LYSIMACHUS
Shall we refresh us
As our intents will need?
Sir
You shall prevail
You have been noble towards her.
Sir
Come
Exeunt
SCENE II:
Enter GOWER
Now our sands are almost run;
More a little
This
What pageantry
To greet the king. So he thrived
To fair Marina; but in no wise
Till he had done his sacrifice
In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd
At Ephesus
That he can hither come so soon
Exit
SCENE III. The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing
near the altar
Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants
of Ephesus attending.
Enter PERICLES
Hail
Who
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
At sea in childbed died she
A maid-child call'd Marina; who
Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years
He sought to murder: but her better stars
Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
Riding
Made known herself my daughter.
Voice and favour!
You are
Faints
What means the nun? she dies! help
Noble sir
Reverend appearer
I threw her overboard with these very arms.
Upon this coast
'Tis most certain.
Look to the lady; O
Early in blustering morn this lady was
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin
Here in Diana's temple.
May we see them?
Great sir
O
If he be none of mine
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear
The voice of dead Thaisa!
That Thaisa am I
And drown'd.
Immortal Dian!
Now I know you better.
When we with tears parted Pentapolis
Shows a ring
This
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well
Melt and no more be seen. O
A second time within these arms.
My heart
Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.
Kneels to THAISA
Look
Thy burden at the sea
For she was yielded there.
Blest
Hail
I know you not.
You have heard me say
Can you remember what I call'd the man?
I have named him oft.
'Twas Helicanus then.
Still confirmation:
Embrace him
Now do I long to hear how you were found;
How possibly preserved; and who to thank
Lord Cerimon
From first to last resolve you.
Reverend sir
More like a god than you. Will you deliver
How this dead queen re-lives?
I will
Beseech you
How she came placed here in the temple;
No needful thing omitted.
Pure Dian
Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd
Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit
Heavens make a star of him! Yet there
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
Lord Cerimon
To hear the rest untold: sir
Exeunt
Enter GOWER
In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
In Pericles
In Helicanus may you well descry
A figure of truth
In reverend Cerimon there well appears
The worth that learned charity aye wears:
For wicked Cleon and his wife
Had spread their cursed deed
Of Pericles
The gods for murder seemed so content
To punish them; although not done
So
Exit
ACT I
SCENE I. London. KING RICHARD II's palace.
Enter KING RICHARD II
Old John of Gaunt
I have
Tell me
Or worthily
As near as I could sift him on that argument
Aim'd at your highness
Then call them to our presence; face to face
The accuser and the accused freely speak:
High-stomach'd are they both
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY
Many years of happy days befal
My gracious sovereign
Each day still better other's happiness;
Until the heavens
We thank you both: yet one but flatters us
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Cousin of Hereford
Against the Duke of Norfolk
First
In the devotion of a subject's love
Now
My body shall make good upon this earth
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant
Once more
And wish
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
First
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
Which else would post until it had return'd
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
Setting aside his high blood's royalty
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
Which to maintain I would allow him odds
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps
Mean time let this defend my loyalty
Pale trembling coward
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
As to take up mine honour's pawn
By that and all the rites of knighthood else
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
And when I mount
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him.
Look
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers
Besides I say and will in battle prove
That ever was survey'd by English eye
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good
Which blood
And
How high a pitch his resolution soars!
Thomas of Norfolk
O
And bid his ears a little while be deaf
Mowbray
Were he my brother
Should nothing privilege him
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
He is our subject
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
Then
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
The other part reserved I by consent
Upon remainder of a dear account
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
For you
Once did I lay an ambush for your life
But ere I last received the sacrament
I did confess it
Your grace's pardon
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd
Which in myself I boldly will defend;
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
Upon this overweening traitor's foot
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
In haste whereof
Your highness to assign our trial day.
Wrath-kindled gentlemen
Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
This we prescribe
Deep malice makes too deep incision;
Forget
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
Good uncle
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk
To be a make-peace shall become my age:
Throw down
And
When
Obedience bids I should not bid again.
Norfolk
Myself I throw
My life thou shalt command
The one my duty owes; but my fair name
I am disgraced
Which breathed this poison.
Rage must be withstood:
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
Yea
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord
Is spotless reputation: that away
A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
Take honour from me
Then
In that I live and for that will I die.
Cousin
O
Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
The slavish motive of recanting fear
Exit JOHN OF GAUNT
We were not born to sue
Which since we cannot do to make you friends
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate:
Since we can not atone you
Justice design the victor's chivalry.
Lord marshal
Be ready to direct these home alarms.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS
Alas
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which made the fault that we cannot correct
Who
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
Edward's seven sons
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course
But Thomas
Ah
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest
In some large measure to thy father's death
Call it not patience
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd
That which in mean men we intitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life
God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute
An angry arm against His minister.
Where then
To God
Why
Thou goest to Coventry
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
O
Or
Farewell
With her companion grief must end her life.
Sister
As much good stay with thee as go with me!
Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls
I take my leave before I have begun
Commend me to thy brother
Lo
Though this be all
I shall remember more. Bid him--ah
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
Alack
But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
Therefore commend me; let him not come there
Desolate
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.
Exeunt
SCENE III. The lists at Coventry.
Enter the Lord Marshal and the DUKE OF AUMERLE
My Lord Aumerle
Yea
The Duke of Norfolk
Why
For nothing but his majesty's approach.
The trumpets sound
Marshal
The cause of his arrival here in arms:
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause.
In God's name and the king's
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms
Speak truly
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
My name is Thomas Mowbray
Who hither come engaged by my oath--
Which God defend a knight should violate!--
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
To God
And
And as I truly fight
The trumpets sound. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Marshal
Thus plated in habiliments of war
What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither
Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
Speak like a true knight
Harry of Hereford
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms
And as I truly fight
On pain of death
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists
Appointed to direct these fair designs.
Lord marshal
For Mowbray and myself are like two men
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving farewell of our several friends.
The appellant in all duty greets your highness
We will descend and fold him in our arms.
Cousin of Hereford
Farewell
O let no noble eye profane a tear
For me
As confident as is the falcon's flight
Against a bird
My loving lord
Of you
Not sick
Lo
The daintiest last
O thou
To reach at victory above my head
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
Be swift like lightning in the execution;
And let thy blows
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
Rouse up thy youthful blood
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
However God or fortune cast my lot
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement
This feast of battle with mine adversary.
Most mighty liege
As gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.
Farewell
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
Order the trial
Harry of Hereford
Strong as a tower in hope
Go bear this lance to Thomas
Harry of Hereford
And dares him to set forward to the fight.
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray
Henry of Hereford
Courageously and with a free desire
Attending but the signal to begin.
Sound
A charge sounded
Stay
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree.
A long flourish
Draw near
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
And for we think the eagle-winged pride
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts
To wake our peace
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums
And make us wade even in our kindred's blood
You
Shall not regreet our fair dominions
Your will be done: this must my comfort be
And those his golden beams to you here lent
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.
Norfolk
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
Breathe I against thee
A heavy sentence
A dearer merit
As to be cast forth in the common air
The language I have learn'd these forty years
And now my tongue's use is to me no more
Than an unstringed viol or a harp
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse
What is thy sentence then but speechless death
It boots thee not to be compassionate:
After our sentence plaining comes too late.
Then thus I turn me from my country's light
Return again
Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
To keep the oath that we administer:
You never shall
Embrace each other's love in banishment;
Nor never look upon each other's face;
Nor never write
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot
'Gainst us
I swear.
And I
Norfolk
By this time
Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
Since thou hast far to go
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.
No
But what thou art
And all too soon
Farewell
Save back to England
Exit
Uncle
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
Hath from the number of his banish'd years
Pluck'd four away.
To HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Six frozen winter spent
How long a time lies in one little word!
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
I thank my liege
He shortens four years of my son's exile:
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
For
Can change their moons and bring their times about
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
My inch of taper will be burnt and done
Why uncle
But not a minute
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age
Thy word is current with him for my death
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
You would have bid me argue like a father.
O
A partial slander sought I to avoid
Alas
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myself this wrong.
Cousin
Six years we banish him
Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train
Cousin
My lord
O
I have too few to take my leave of you
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
Joy absent
What is six winters? they are quickly gone.
To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so
The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
The precious jewel of thy home return.
Nay
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love.
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages
But that I was a journeyman to grief?
All places that the eye of heaven visits
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
There is no virtue like necessity.
Think not the king did banish thee
Go
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
Look
To lie that way thou go'st
Suppose the singing birds musicians
Than a delightful measure or a dance;
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
O
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast?
Or wallow naked in December snow
By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
O
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
Than when he bites
Come
Had I thy youth and cause
Then
My mother
Where'er I wander
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The court.
Enter KING RICHARD II
We did observe. Cousin Aumerle
I brought high Hereford
And say
Faith
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
What said our cousin when you parted with him?
'Farewell:'
And
Should so profane the word
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
Marry
And added years to his short banishment
But since it would not
He is our cousin
Ourself and Bushy
Observed his courtship to the common people;
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy
And patient underbearing of his fortune
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee
As were our England in reversion his
Well
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland
For their advantage and your highness' loss.
We will ourself in person to this war:
And
And liberal largess
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs in hand: if that come short
Whereto
And send them after to supply our wants;
For we will make for Ireland presently.
Enter BUSHY
Bushy
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick
To entreat your majesty to visit him.
Where lies he?
At Ely House.
Now put it
To help him to his grave immediately!
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
Come
Pray God we may make haste
Amen.
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. Ely House.
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick
Will the king come
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
Vex not yourself
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
O
Enforce attention like deep harmony:
Where words are scarce
He that no more must say is listen'd more
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
The setting sun
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds
The open ear of youth doth always listen;
Report of fashions in proud Italy
Limps after in base imitation.
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
So it be new
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard
Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
'Tis breath thou lack'st
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
Small showers last long
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light vanity
This royal throne of kings
Against infection and the hand of war
England
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
Of watery Neptune
That England
Ah
Enter KING RICHARD II and QUEEN
The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.
How fares our noble uncle
What comfort
O how that name befits my composition!
Old Gaunt indeed
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
Watching breeds leanness
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon
And therein fasting
Gaunt am I for the grave
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
No
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
Should dying men flatter with those that live?
No
Thou
O
I am in health
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
Ill in myself to see
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
And thou
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
And yet
O
Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons
Why
But for thy world enjoying but this land
Landlord of England art thou now
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--
A lunatic lean-witted fool
Make pale our cheek
With fury from his native residence.
Now
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.
O
That blood already
My brother Gloucester
May be a precedent and witness good
That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:
Join with the present sickness that I have;
And thy unkindness be like crooked age
Live in thy shame
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
Convey me to my bed
Love they to live that love and honour have.
Exit
And let them die that age and sullens have;
For both hast thou
I do beseech your majesty
To wayward sickliness and age in him:
He loves you
As Harry Duke of Hereford
Right
As theirs
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
My liege
What says he?
Nay
His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
Words
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
Though death be poor
The ripest fruit first falls
His time is spent
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns
But only they have privilege to live.
And for these great affairs do ask some charge
The plate
How long shall I be patient? ah
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
Not Gloucester's death
Not Gaunt's rebukes
About his marriage
I am the last of noble Edward's sons
In war was never lion raged more fierce
His face thou hast
But when he frown'd
And not against his friends; his noble hand
Did will what he did spend and spent not that
Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief
Why
O my liege
Not to be pardon'd
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
Is not Gaunt dead
Was not Gaunt just
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
Take Hereford's rights away
His charters and his customary rights;
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
But by fair sequence and succession?
Now
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights
By his attorneys-general to sue
His livery
And prick my tender patience
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
Think what you will
His plate
I'll not be by the while: my liege
What will ensue hereof
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good.
Exit
Go
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
To see this business. To-morrow next
We will for Ireland; and 'tis time
And we create
For he is just and always loved us well.
Come on
Be merry
Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II
Well
And living too; for now his son is duke.
Barely in title
Richly in both
My heart is great; but it must break with silence
Nay
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
If it be so
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.
No good at all that I can do for him;
Unless you call it good to pity him
Now
In him
Of noble blood in this declining land.
The king is not himself
By flatterers; and what they will inform
'Gainst us
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes
For ancient quarrels
And daily new exactions are devised
But what
Wars have not wasted it
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
The king's grown bankrupt
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
He hath not money for these Irish wars
His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
But
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails
We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
And unavoided is the danger now
Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering; but I dare not say
How near the tidings of our comfort is.
Nay
Be confident to speak
We three are but thyself; and
Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc
In Brittany
That Harry Duke of Hereford
With eight tall ships
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
Perhaps they had ere this
The first departing of the king for Ireland.
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
And make high majesty look like itself
But if you faint
To horse
Hold out my horse
Exeunt
SCENE II. The palace.
Enter QUEEN
Madam
You promised
And entertain a cheerful disposition.
To please the king I did; to please myself
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief
As my sweet Richard: yet again
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
For sorrow's eye
Like perspectives
Show nothing but confusion
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty
Which
Of what it is not. Then
Or if it be
It may be so; but yet my inward soul
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be
As
'Tis nothing but conceit
'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
From some forefather grief; mine is not so
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
But what it is
I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe
Enter GREEN
God save your majesty! and well met
I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
For his designs crave haste
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
That he
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself
At Ravenspurgh.
Now God in heaven forbid!
Ah
Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
Hath broke his staff
To Bolingbroke.
So
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
Despair not
Who shall hinder me?
I will despair
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer
Enter DUKE OF YORK
Here comes the Duke of York.
With signs of war about his aged neck:
O
Uncle
Should I do so
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth
Your husband
Here am I left to underprop his land
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.
Enter a Servant
My lord
He was? Why
The nobles they are fled
Sirrah
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
Hold
My lord
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
What is't
An hour before I came
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
I know not what to do: I would to God
What
How shall we do for money for these wars?
Come
Go
And bring away the armour that is there.
Exit Servant
Gentlemen
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands
The one is my sovereign
And duty bids defend; the other again
Is my kinsman
Well
Dispose of you.
Gentlemen
I should to Plashy too;
But time will not permit: all is uneven
Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible.
Besides
Is near the hate of those love not the king.
And that's the wavering commons: for their love
Lies in their purses
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
If judgement lie in them
Well
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
Thither will I with you; for little office
The hateful commons will perform for us
Will you go along with us?
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
Alas
Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
Where one on his side fights
Farewell at once
Well
I fear me
Exeunt
SCENE III. Wilds in Gloucestershire.
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND
How far is it
Believe me
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles
But I bethink me what a weary way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby
The tediousness and process of my travel:
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
The present benefit which I possess;
And hope to joy is little less in joy
Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
Shall make their way seem short
By sight of what I have
Of much less value is my company
Than your good words. But who comes here?
Enter HENRY PERCY
It is my son
Harry
I had thought
Why
No
The household of the king.
What was his reason?
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
But he
What power the Duke of York had levied there;
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford
No
Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge
Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
My gracious lord
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert.
I thank thee
I count myself in nothing else so happy
As in a soul remembering my good friends;
And
My heart this covenant makes
How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
There stands the castle
And in it are the Lords of York
None else of name and noble estimate.
Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY
Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby
Welcome
A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
Is yet but unfelt thanks
Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
Your presence makes us rich
And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
Evermore thanks
Which
Enter LORD BERKELEY
It is my Lord of Berkeley
My Lord of Hereford
My lord
And I am come to seek that name in England;
And I must find that title in your tongue
Mistake me not
To raze one title of your honour out:
To you
To take advantage of the absent time
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.
Enter DUKE OF YORK attended
I shall not need transport my words by you;
Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!
Kneels
Show me thy humble heart
My gracious uncle--
Tut
Grace me no grace
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom
And ostentation of despised arms?
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
Why
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt
Rescued the Black Prince
Now prisoner to the palsy
And minister correction to thy fault!
My gracious uncle
On what condition stands it and wherein?
Even in condition of the worst degree
Thou art a banish'd man
Before the expiration of thy time
As I was banish'd
But as I come
And
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
You are my father
I see old Gaunt alive; O
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be King of England
You have a son
Had you first died
I am denied to sue my livery here
My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold
What would you have me do? I am a subject
And therefore
To my inheritance of free descent.
The noble duke hath been too much abused.
It stands your grace upon to do him right.
Base men by his endowments are made great.
My lords of England
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
And laboured all I could to do him right;
But in this kind to come
And you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own; and for the right of that
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
Well
I cannot mend it
But if I could
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
But since I cannot
I do remain as neuter. So
Unless you please to enter in the castle
And there repose you for this night.
An offer
But we must win your grace to go with us
To Bristol castle
By Bushy
It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
For I am loath to break our country's laws.
Nor friends nor foes
Things past redress are now with me past care.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. A camp in Wales.
Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain
My lord of Salisbury
Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.
Stay yet another day
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.
'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled
Exit
Ah
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
Exit
ACT III
SCENE I. Bristol. Before the castle.
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Bring forth these men.
Bushy and Green
Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
With too much urging your pernicious lives
From off my hands
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
You have misled a prince
You have in manner with your sinful hours
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
Myself
Till you did make him misinterpret me
Whilst you have fed upon my signories
This and much more
To execution and the hand of death.
More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
My Lord Northumberland
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others
Uncle
For God's sake
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
With letters of your love to her at large.
Thank
To fight with Glendower and his complices:
Awhile to work
Exeunt
SCENE II. The coast of Wales. A castle in view.
Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD II
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
Yea
Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
To stand upon my kingdom once again.
Dear earth
As a long-parted mother with her child
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
Feed not thy sovereign's foe
But let thy spiders
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
Mock not my senseless conjuration
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers
Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
Fear not
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
The means that heaven yields must be embraced
He means
Whilst Bolingbroke
Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
In murders and in outrage
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole
So when this thief
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord:
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
A glorious angel: then
Enter EARL OF SALISBURY
Welcome
Nor near nor farther off
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
One day too late
O
To-day
For all the Welshmen
Are gone to Bolingbroke
Comfort
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face
And
All souls that will be safe fly from my side
Comfort
I had forgot myself; am I not king?
Awake
Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
Arm
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP
More health and happiness betide my liege
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
Say
And what loss is it to be rid of care?
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
They break their faith to God as well as us:
Cry woe
The worst is death
Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
To bear the tidings of calamity.
Like an unseasonable stormy day
Of Bolingbroke
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
Against thy majesty; boys
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
Yea
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel
Too well
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
If we prevail
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.
Peace have they made with him indeed
O villains
Dogs
Snakes
Three Judases
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
Sweet love
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
With heads
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
And lie full low
Is Bushy
Ay
Where is the duke my father with his power?
No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
Let's talk of graves
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
And yet not so
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
How some have been deposed; some slain in war
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence: throw away respect
I live with bread like you
My lord
To fear the foe
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
And fight and die is death destroying death;
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
My father hath a power; inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb.
Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
An easy task it is to win our own.
Say
Speak sweetly
Men judge by the complexion of the sky
The state and inclination of the day:
So may you by my dull and heavy eye
I play the torturer
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke
Upon his party.
Thou hast said enough.
Beshrew thee
To DUKE OF AUMERLE
Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
What say you now? what comfort have we now?
By heaven
That bids me be of comfort any more.
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
A king
That power I have
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow
To alter this
My liege
He does me double wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
Discharge my followers: let them hence away
Exeunt
SCENE III. Wales. Before Flint castle.
Enter
So that by this intelligence we learn
The Welshmen are dispersed
Is gone to meet the king
With some few private friends upon this coast.
The news is very fair and good
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
When such a sacred king should hide his head.
Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
Left I his title out.
The time hath been
Have been so brief with you
Mistake not
Take not
Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.
I know it
Against their will. But who comes here?
Enter HENRY PERCY
Welcome
The castle royally is mann'd
Royally!
Why
Yes
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
And with him are the Lord Aumerle
Of holy reverence; who
O
Noble lords
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Into his ruin'd ears
Henry Bolingbroke
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most royal person
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power
And lands restored again be freely granted:
If not
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
The which
It is
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land
Go
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
Let's march without the noise of threatening drum
Our fair appointments may be well perused.
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no less terror than the elements
Of fire and water
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Be he the fire
The rage be his
My waters; on the earth
March on
Parle without
See
From out the fiery portal of the east
To dim his glory and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occident.
Yet looks he like a king: behold
Controlling majesty: alack
We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee
Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
And if we be
To pay their awful duty to our presence?
If we be not
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
For well we know
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
And though you think that all
Yet know
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
The purple testament of bleeding war;
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace
Shall ill become the flower of England's face
To scarlet indignation and bedew
Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
And by the honourable tomb he swears
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:
Which on thy royal party granted once
To faithful service of your majesty.
This swears he
And
Northumberland
His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
And all the number of his fair demands
Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
With all the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
We do debase ourselves
To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
Shall we call back Northumberland
Defiance to the traitor
No
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
O God
On yon proud man
With words of sooth! O that I were as great
As is my grief
Or that I could forget what I have been
Swell'st thou
Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
What must the king do now? must he submit?
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
The king shall be contented: must he lose
The name of king? o' God's name
I'll give my jewels for a set of beads
And my large kingdom for a little grave
Or I'll be buried in the king's highway
May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
And buried once
Aumerle
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes
As thus
Within the earth; and
Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
Would not this ill do well? Well
I talk but idly
Most mighty prince
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
You make a leg
My lord
To speak with you; may it please you to come down.
Down
In the base court? Base court
In the base court? Come down? Down
down
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing.
Exeunt from above
What says his majesty?
Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him speak fondly
Yet he is come.
Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below
Stand all apart
He kneels down
My gracious lord
Fair cousin
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
Up
My gracious lord
Your own is yours
So far be mine
Well you deserve: they well deserve to have
Uncle
Tears show their love
Cousin
What you will have
For do we must what force will have us do.
Set on towards London
Yea
Then I must not say no.
Flourish. Exeunt
SCENE IV. LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.
Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies
What sport shall we devise here in this garden
Madam
'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs
Madam
My legs can keep no measure in delight
Therefore
Madam
Of sorrow or of joy?
Of either
Of neither
For of joy
Or if of grief
For what I have I need not to repeat;
And what I want it boots not to complain.
Madam
'Tis well that thou hast cause
But thou shouldst please me better
I could weep
And I could sing
Enter a Gardener
But stay
Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
My wretchedness unto a row of pins
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.
QUEEN and Ladies retire
Go
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
Go thou
All must be even in our government.
You thus employ'd
The noisome weeds
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
Why should we in the compass of a pale
Keep law and form and due proportion
Swarming with caterpillars?
Hold thy peace:
He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter
What
They are; and Bolingbroke
Hath seized the wasteful king. O
That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
As we this garden! We at time of year
Do wound the bark
Had he done so to great and growing men
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
We lop away
Had he done so
What
Depress'd he is already
'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's
O
Coming forward
Thou
What Eve
To make a second fall of cursed man?
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
Darest thou
Pardon me
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
King Richard
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
In your lord's scale is nothing but himself
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke
Post you to London
I speak no more than every one doth know.
Nimble mischance
To serve me last
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come
What
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
Gardener
Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
I'll set a bank of rue
Rue
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. Westminster Hall.
Enter
Call forth Bagot.
Now
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death
The bloody office of his timeless end.
Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
Cousin
My Lord Aumerle
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted
As far as Calais
Amongst much other talk
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
Adding withal how blest this land would be
In this your cousin's death.
Princes and noble lords
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars
Either I must
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
There is my gage
In thy heart-blood
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
Bagot
Excepting one
In all this presence that hath moved me so.
If that thy valour stand on sympathy
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
If thou deny'st it twenty times
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
Thou darest not
Now by my soul
Fitzwater
Aumerle
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
And that thou art so
Of mortal breathing: seize it
An if I do not
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
I task the earth to the like
And spur thee on with full as many lies
As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
Engage it to the trial
Who sets me else? by heaven
I have a thousand spirits in one breast
My Lord Fitzwater
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
And you can witness with me this is true.
As false
Surrey
Dishonourable boy!
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
In proof whereof
Engage it to the trial
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
If I dare eat
As I intend to thrive in this new world
Besides
That thou
To execute the noble duke at Calais.
Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this
These differences shall all rest under gage
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be
To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd
That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field
Against black pagans
And toil'd with works of war
To Italy; and there at Venice gave
His body to that pleasant country's earth
Why
As surely as I live
Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants
Till we assign you to your days of trial.
Enter DUKE OF YORK
Great Duke of Lancaster
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
Adopts thee heir
To the possession of thy royal hand:
Ascend his throne
And long live Henry
In God's name
Marry. God forbid!
Worst in this royal presence may I speak
Would God that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence on his king?
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear
And shall the figure of God's majesty
Should show so heinous
I speak to subjects
My Lord of Hereford here
And if you crown him
The blood of English shall manure the ground
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
Disorder
Shall here inhabit
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
O
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
Prevent it
Well have you argued
My Lord of Westminster
To keep him safely till his day of trial.
May it please you
Fetch hither Richard
He may surrender; so we shall proceed
Without suspicion.
I will be his conduct.
Exit
Lords
Little are we beholding to your love
Re-enter DUKE OF YORK
Alack
Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
To insinuate
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission. Yet I well remember
The favours of these men: were they not mine?
Did they not sometime cry
So Judas did to Christ: but he
God save the king! Will no man say amen?
Am I both priest and clerk? well then
God save the king! although I be not he;
And yet
To do what service am I sent for hither?
To do that office of thine own good will
Which tired majesty did make thee offer
To Henry Bolingbroke.
Give me the crown. Here
Here cousin:
On this side my hand
Now is this golden crown like a deep well
That owes two buckets
That bucket down and full of tears am I
I thought you had been willing to resign.
My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
You may my glories and my state depose
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
My care is loss of care
Your care is gain of care
The cares I give I have
They tend the crown
Are you contented to resign the crown?
Ay
Therefore no no
Now mark me
I give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
With mine own tears I wash away my balm
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
My manors
My acts
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
Make me
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit
God save King Harry
What more remains?
No more
These accusations and these grievous crimes
Committed by your person and your followers
Against the state and profit of this land;
That
May deem that you are worthily deposed.
Must I do so? and must I ravel out
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath
Nay
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross
My lord
Mine eyes are full of tears
And yet salt water blinds them not so much
But they can see a sort of traitors here.
Nay
For I have given here my soul's consent
To undeck the pompous body of a king;
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave
My lord
No lord of thine
O that I were a mockery king of snow
Good king
Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
Exit an attendant
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
Fiend
Urge it no more
The commons will not then be satisfied.
They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough
Where all my sins are writ
Re-enter Attendant
Give me the glass
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
So many blows upon this face of mine
That every day under his household roof
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
That
Was this the face that faced so many follies
A brittle glory shineth in this face:
As brittle as the glory is the face;
Dashes the glass against the ground
For there it is
Mark
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
The shadow or your face.
Say that again.
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
'Tis very true
And these external manners of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
There lies the substance: and I thank thee
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon
Shall I obtain it?
Name it
'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
For when I was a king
Were then but subjects; being now a subject
Being so great
Yet ask.
And shall I have?
You shall.
Then give me leave to go.
Whither?
Whither you will
Go
O
Exeunt KING RICHARD II
On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation: lords
Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
You holy clergymen
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
My lord
To bury mine intents
Whatever I shall happen to devise.
I see your brows are full of discontent
Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay
A plot shall show us all a merry day.
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. London. A street leading to the Tower.
Enter QUEEN and Ladies
This way the king will come; this is the way
To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower
Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
Here let us rest
Have any resting for her true king's queen.
Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard
But soft
Ah
Join not with grief
From which awaked
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother
Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house:
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown
What
Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou
A king of beasts
Good sometime queen
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid;
And ere thou bid good night
And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
For why
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassion weep the fire out;
And some will mourn in ashes
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others
My lord
You must to Pomfret
And
With all swift speed you must away to France.
Northumberland
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think
And he shall think that thou
To plant unrightful kings
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
The love of wicked men converts to fear;
That fear to hate
To worthy danger and deserved death.
My guilt be on my head
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
Doubly divorced! Bad men
A twofold marriage
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
And yet not so
Part us
My wife to France: from whence
And must we be divided? must we part?
Ay
Banish us both and send the king with me.
That were some love but little policy.
Then whither he goes
So two
Weep thou for me in France
Better far off than near
Go
So longest way shall have the longest moans.
Twice for one step I'll groan
Come
One kiss shall stop our mouths
Thus give I mine
Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
So
We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
Once more
Exeunt
SCENE II. The DUKE OF YORK's palace.
Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK
My lord
Where did I leave?
At that sad stop
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
Then
Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know
You would have thought the very windows spake
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage
With painted imagery had said at once
'Jesu preserve thee! welcome
Whilst he
And thus still doing
Alack
As in a theatre
Even so
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
The hearts of men
And barbarism itself have pitied him.
But heaven hath a hand in these events
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
Here comes my son Aumerle.
Aumerle that was;
But that is lost for being Richard's friend
I am in parliament pledge for his truth
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE
Welcome
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
Madam
God knows I had as lief be none as one.
Well
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?
For aught I know
You will be there
If God prevent not
What seal is that
Yea
My lord
No matter
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
It is a matter of small consequence
Which for some reasons
I fear
What should you fear?
'Tis nothing but some bond
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
That he is bound to? Wife
Boy
I do beseech you
I will be satisfied; let me see it
He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
What is the matter
Ho! who is within there?
Enter a Servant
Saddle my horse.
God for his mercy
Why
Give me my boots
Now
What is the matter?
Peace
I will not peace. What is the matter
Good mother
Than my poor life must answer.
Thy life answer!
Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
Re-enter Servant with boots
Strike him
Hence
Give me my boots
Why
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
Thou fond mad woman
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament
He shall be none;
We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?
Away
Hadst thou groan'd for him
As I have done
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed
Sweet York
He is as like thee as a man may be
Make way
Exit
After
Spur post
I'll not be long behind; though I be old
And never will I rise up from the ground
Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away
Exeunt
SCENE III. A royal palace.
Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
If any plague hang over us
I would to God
Inquire at London
Which he
So dissolute a crew.
My lord
And what said the gallant?
His answer was
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope
May happily bring forth. But who comes here?
Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE
Where is the king?
What means our cousin
So wildly?
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty
Withdraw yourselves
Exeunt HENRY PERCY and Lords
What is the matter with our cousin now?
For ever may my knees grow to the earth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
Intended or committed was this fault?
If on the first
Then give me leave that I may turn the key
Have thy desire.
[Within]  My liege
Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.
Villain
Drawing
Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
[Within]  Open the door
Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?
Open the door
Enter DUKE OF YORK
What is the matter
Recover breath; tell us how near is danger
Peruse this writing here
The treason that my haste forbids me show.
Remember
I do repent me; read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand.
It was
I tore it from the traitor's bosom
Fear
Forget to pity him
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
O heinous
O loyal father of a treacherous son!
Thou sheer
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Thy overflow of good converts to bad
This deadly blot in thy digressing son.
So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath
[Within]  What ho
What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?
A woman
Speak with me
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing
My dangerous cousin
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.
If thou do pardon
This fester'd joint cut off
This let alone will all the rest confound.
Enter DUCHESS OF YORK
O king
Love loving not itself none other can.
Thou frantic woman
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?
Sweet York
Kneels
Rise up
Not yet
For ever will I walk upon my knees
Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
Against them both my true joints bended be.
Ill mayst thou thrive
Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
His eyes do drop no tears
His words come from his mouth
He prays but faintly and would be denied;
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
His weary joints would gladly rise
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
Good aunt
Nay
Say
And if I were thy nurse
I never long'd to hear a word till now;
Say 'pardon
The word is short
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
Speak it in French
Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
Ah
Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
The chopping French we do not understand.
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
Good aunt
I do not sue to stand;
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
I pardon him
O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain
With all my heart
I pardon him.
A god on earth thou art.
But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot
Good uncle
To Oxford
They shall not live within this world
Uncle
Your mother well hath pray'd
Come
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The same.
Enter EXTON and Servant
Didst thou not mark the king
Was it not so?
These were his very words.
'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice
He did.
And speaking it
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come
I am the king's friend
Exeunt
SCENE V. Pomfret castle.
Enter KING RICHARD
I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world:
And for because the world is populous
And here is not a creature but myself
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul
A generation of still-breeding thoughts
With scruples and do set the word itself
Against the word:
As thus
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
Thoughts tending to ambition
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
And in this thought they find a kind of ease
Of such as have before endured the like.
Thus play I in one person many people
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
Persuades me I was better when a king;
Then am I king'd again: and by and by
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke
With nothing shall be pleased
With being nothing. Music do I hear?
Music
Ha
So is it in the music of men's lives.
And here have I the daintiness of ear
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
But for the concord of my state and time
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
I wasted time
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes
Now sir
Are clamorous groans
Show minutes
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy
This music mads me; let it sound no more;
For though it have holp madmen to their wits
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.
Enter a Groom of the Stable
Hail
Thanks
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
What art thou? and how comest thou hither
That brings me food to make misfortune live?
I was a poor groom of thy stable
To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
O
In London streets
Rode he on Barbary? Tell me
So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
Forgiveness
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass
Enter Keeper
Fellow
If thou love me
What my tongue dares not
Exit
My lord
Taste of it first
My lord
lately came from the king
The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
Patience is stale
Beats the keeper
Help
Enter EXTON and Servants
How now! what means death in this rude assault?
Villain
Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him
Go thou
He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down
That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
That staggers thus my person. Exton
Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
Mount
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward
Dies
As full of valour as of royal blood:
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
For now the devil
This dead king to the living king I'll bear
Take hence the rest
Exeunt
SCENE VI. Windsor castle.
Flourish. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE
Kind uncle York
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
Welcome
First
The next news is
The heads of Oxford
The manner of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here.
We thank thee
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.
Enter LORD FITZWATER
My lord
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.
Thy pains
Right noble is thy merit
Enter HENRY PERCY
The grand conspirator
Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
But here is Carlisle living
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.
Carlisle
Choose out some secret place
So as thou livest in peace
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been
Enter EXTON
Great king
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies
Exton
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land.
From your own mouth
They love not poison that do poison need
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour
With Cain go wander through shades of night
Lords
Come
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
In weeping after this untimely bier.
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. London. A street.
Enter GLOUCESTER
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I
I
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I
Into this breathing world
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive
Clarence comes.
Enter CLARENCE
Brother
That waits upon your grace?
His majesty
Tendering my person's safety
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
Upon what cause?
Because my name is George.
Alack
He should
O
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
But what's the matter
Yea
As yet I do not: but
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be;
And
These
Have moved his highness to commit me now.
Why
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
My Lady Grey his wife
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she and that good man of worship
We are not safe
By heaven
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference
Even so; an't please your worship
We speak no treason
Is wise and virtuous
Well struck in years
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
With this
Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee
What one
Her husband
I beseech your grace to pardon me
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
We know thy charge
We are the queen's abjects
Brother
And whatsoever you will employ me in
Meantime
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
Well
Meantime
I must perforce. Farewell.
Exeunt CLARENCE
Go
Simple
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
Enter HASTINGS
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
With patience
But I shall live
That were the cause of my imprisonment.
No doubt
For they that were your enemies are his
More pity that the eagle should be mew'd
What news abroad?
No news so bad abroad as this at home;
The King is sickly
Now
O
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
What
He is.
Go you before
Exit HASTINGS
He cannot live
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
I'll in
And
Which done
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father:
The which will I; not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent
But yet I run before my horse to market:
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
When they are gone
Exit
SCENE II. The same. Another street.
Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth
Set down
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
Lo
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
More direful hap betide that hated wretch
If ever he have child
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
If ever he have wife
A miserable by the death of him
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
Come
And still
Enter GLOUCESTER
Stay
What black magician conjures up this fiend
Villains
My lord
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast
What
Alas
Avaunt
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body
Sweet saint
Foul devil
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
O
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
Blush
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
From cold and empty veins
Thy deed
O God
O earth
Either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
Lady
Villain
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
But I know none
O wonderful
More wonderful
Vouchsafe
Vouchsafe
Fairer than tongue can name thee
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
Fouler than heart can think thee
No excuse current
By such despair
And
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
Say that I slew them not?
Why
But dead they are
I did not kill your husband.
Why
Nay
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
The which thou once didst bend against her breast
I was provoked by her slanderous tongue
Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
Didst thou not kill this king?
I grant ye.
Dost grant me
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
O
The fitter for the King of heaven
He is in heaven
Let him thank me
For he was fitter for that place than earth.
And thou unfit for any place but hell.
Yes
Some dungeon.
Your bed-chamber.
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
So will it
I hope so.
I know so. But
Of these Plantagenets
Thou art the cause
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world
If I thought that
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You should not blemish it
As all the world is cheered by the sun
Black night o'ershade thy day
Curse not thyself
I would I were
It is a quarrel most unnatural
It is a quarrel just and reasonable
He that bereft thee
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
He lives that loves thee better than he could.
Name him.
Plantagenet.
Why
The selfsame name
Where is he?
Here.
She spitteth at him
Why dost thou spit at me?
Would it were mortal poison
Never came poison from so sweet a place.
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
Thine eyes
Would they were basilisks
I would they were
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee
She looks scornfully at him
Teach not thy lips such scorn
For kissing
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee
He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword
Nay
Nay
Here she lets fall the sword
Take up the sword again
Arise
Then bid me kill myself
I have already.
Tush
Speak it again
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
I would I knew thy heart.
'Tis figured in my tongue.
I fear me both are false.
Then never man was true.
Well
Say
That shall you know hereafter.
But shall I live in hope?
All men
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
To take is not to give.
Look
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand
What is it?
That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner
Where
At Chertsey monastery this noble king
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you
With all my heart; and much it joys me too
Tressel and Berkeley
Bid me farewell.
'Tis more than you deserve;
But since you teach me how to flatter you
Exeunt LADY ANNE
Sirs
Towards Chertsey
No
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I
Having God
against me
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
And will she yet debase her eyes on me
On me
On me
My dukedom to a beggarly denier
Upon my life
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass
Since I am crept in favour with myself
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out
Exit
SCENE III. The palace.
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH
Have patience
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
In that you brook it in
Therefore
If he were dead
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
Oh
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
It is determined
But so it must be
Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
Good time of day unto your royal grace!
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
The Countess Richmond
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
I do beseech you
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or
From wayward sickness
Saw you the king to-day
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.
What likelihood of his amendment
Madam
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
Madam
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
Would all were well! but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest.
Enter GLOUCESTER
They do me wrong
Who are they that complain unto the king
By holy Paul
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
By silken
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
To thee
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all! His royal person
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while
Brother of Gloucester
The king
Aiming
Against my kindred
The ground of your ill-will
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad
Since every Jack became a gentleman
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
Come
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends':
God grant we never may have need of you!
Meantime
Your brother is imprison'd by your means
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce
By Him that raised me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd
Against the Duke of Clarence
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord
You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
She may
She may
She may do more
She may help you to many fair preferments
What may she not? She may
What
What
I wis your grandam had a worser match.
My Lord of Gloucester
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen
Enter QUEEN MARGARET
Small joy have I in being England's queen.
And lessen'd be that small
Thy honour
What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
Out
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower
Ere you were queen
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
Yea
In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds
Withal
A murderous villain
Poor Clarence did forsake his father
Yea
Which God revenge!
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed
I would to God my heart were flint
Or Edward's soft and pitiful
I am too childish-foolish for this world.
Hie thee to hell for shame
My Lord of Gloucester
Which here you urge to prove us enemies
So should we you
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart
As little joy
You should enjoy
That I enjoy
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she
I can no longer hold me patient.
Advancing
Hear me
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not
O gentle villain
Foul wrinkled witch
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That will I make before I let thee go.
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have
The curse my noble father laid on thee
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses
Denounced against thee
And God
So just is God
O
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
No man but prophesied revenge for it.
Northumberland
What were you snarling all before I came
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
That Henry's death
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why
If not by war
Edward thy son
Thyself a queen
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
And
Rivers and Dorset
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God
Have done thy charm
And leave out thee? stay
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee
On thee
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
Margaret.
Richard!
Ha!
I call thee not.
I cry thee mercy then
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
Why
O
'Tis done by me
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
Poor painted queen
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
Fool
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
False-boding woman
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
Were you well served
To serve me well
O
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
Peace
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
O
What 'twere to lose it
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if they fall
Good counsel
It toucheth you
Yea
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my son
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God
As it was won with blood
Have done! for shame
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt
My charity is outrage
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
Have done
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky
O Buckingham
Look
Have not to do with him
Sin
What doth she say
Nothing that I respect
What
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O
Live each of you the subjects to his hate
Exit
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother
My part thereof that I have done to her.
I never did her any
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good
Marry
God pardon them that are the cause of it!
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion
So do I ever:
Aside
being well-advised.
For had I cursed now
Enter CATESBY
Madam
Catesby
Madam
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
I do the wrong
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence
Namely
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now
To be revenged on Rivers
But then I sigh; and
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint
Enter two Murderers
But
How now
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
We are
That we may be admitted where he is.
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
Gives the warrant
When you have done
But
For Clarence is well-spoken
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
Tush!
Fear not
Talkers are no good doers: be assured
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
Your eyes drop millstones
I like you
Go
We will
Exeunt
SCENE IV. London. The Tower.
Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY
Why looks your grace so heavily today?
O
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
And
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches
Lord
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and
Where eyes did once inhabit
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul
To seek the empty
But smother'd it within my panting bulk
Awaked you not with this sore agony?
O
O
The first that there did greet my stranger soul
Who cried aloud
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud
Seize on him
With that
Environ'd me about
Such hideous cries
I trembling waked
Could not believe but that I was in hell
No marvel
I promise
O Brakenbury
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
I pray thee
My soul is heavy
I will
CLARENCE sleeps
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
Princes have but their tides for their glories
And
So that
Enter the two Murderers
Ho! who's here?
In God's name what are you
I would speak with Clarence
Yea
O sir
him our commission; talk no more.
BRAKENBURY reads it
I am
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
I will not reason what is meant hereby
Here are the keys
I'll to the king; and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
Do so
Exit BRAKENBURY
What
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly
When he wakes! why
the judgment-day.
Why
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.
What
Not to kill him
damned for killing him
I thought thou hadst been resolute.
So I am
Back to the Duke of Gloucester
I pray thee
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.
How dost thou feel thyself now?
'Faith
within me.
Remember our reward
'Zounds
Where is thy conscience now?
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
How if it come to thee again?
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal
accuseth him; he cannot swear
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it.
'Zounds
not to kill the duke.
Take the devil in thy mind
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
Tut
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. Come
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword
in the next room.
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
No
Where art thou
You shall have wine enough
In God's name
A man
But not
Nor you
Thy voice is thunder
My voice is now the king's
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
To
To murder me?
Ay
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
Wherein
Offended us you have not
I shall be reconciled to him again.
Never
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law
I charge you
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins
The deed you undertake is damnable.
What we will do
And he that hath commanded is the king.
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament
And
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged for this deed.
O
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.
Who made thee
My brother's love
Thy brother's love
Oh
I am his brother
If you be hired for meed
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
You are deceived
O
Go you to him from me.
Ay
Tell him
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
Bid Gloucester think of this
Ay
O
Right
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
It cannot be; for when I parted with him
Why
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
Make peace with God
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul
Ah
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
What shall we do?
Relent
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
Not to relent is beastly
Which of you
My friend
O
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
Look behind you
Take that
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
Exit
A bloody deed
How fain
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
Re-enter First Murderer
How now! what mean'st thou
By heavens
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
Take thou the fee
For I repent me that the duke is slain.
Exit
So do not I: go
Now must I hide his body in some hole
And when I have my meed
For this will out
ACT II
SCENE I. London. The palace.
Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick
Why
You peers
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven
Rivers and Hastings
Dissemble not your hatred
By heaven
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
So thrive I
Take heed you dally not before your king;
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood
Either of you to be the other's end.
So prosper I
And I
Madam
You have been factious one against the other
And what you do
Here
Our former hatred
Dorset
This interchange of love
And so swear I
They embrace
Now
With thy embracements to my wife's allies
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours
but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend
Deep
A pleasing cordial
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
And
Enter GLOUCESTER
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
And
Happy
Brother
Made peace enmity
A blessed labour
Amongst this princely heap
If I unwittingly
By any in this presence
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
I hate it
First
Of you
Of you
That without desert have frown'd on me;
Dukes
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
More than the infant that is born to-night
I thank my God for my humility.
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
My sovereign liege
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
Why
To be so bouted in this royal presence?
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
They all start
You do him injury to scorn his corse.
Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
All seeing heaven
Look I so pale
Ay
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
But he
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand
God grant that some
Enter DERBY
A boon
I pray thee
I will not rise
Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
The forfeit
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
Have a tongue to doom my brother's death
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought
Who sued to me for him? who
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick
Who told me
When Oxford had me down
Who told me
Frozen almost to death
Even in his own garments
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Sinfully pluck'd
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
Have done a drunken slaughter
The precious image of our dear Redeemer
And I unjustly too
But for my brother not a man would speak
For him
Have been beholding to him in his life;
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
O God
On me
Come
Oh
Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
How that the guilty kindred of the queen
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
O
God will revenge it. But come
We wait upon your grace.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The palace.
Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK
Tell me
No
Why do you wring your hands
Why do you look on us
If that our noble father be alive?
My pretty cousins
I do lament the sickness of the king.
As loath to lose him
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
Then
The king my uncle is to blame for this:
God will revenge it; whom I will importune
With daily prayers all to that effect.
And so will I.
Peace
Incapable and shallow innocents
Grandam
Told me
And when my uncle told me so
Bade me rely on him as on my father
Oh
He is my son; yea
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
Think you my uncle did dissemble
Ay
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH
Oh
I'll join with black despair against my soul
What means this scene of rude impatience?
To make an act of tragic violence:
Edward
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
If you will live
Or
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
Ah
As I had title in thy noble husband!
I have bewept a worthy husband's death
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
Good aunt
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
Give me no help in lamentation;
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
Oh for my husband
Oh for our father
Alas for both
What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
Was never widow had so dear a loss!
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
Was never mother had so dear a loss!
Alas
Their woes are parcell'd
She for an Edward weeps
I for a Clarence weep
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
I for an Edward weep
Alas
Comfort
That you take with unthankfulness
In common worldly things
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven
Madam
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave
Enter GLOUCESTER
Madam
To wail the dimming of our shining star;
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
Madam
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing.
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind
[Aside]  Amen; and make me die a good old man!
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers
Though we have spent our harvest of this king
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts
Me seemeth good
Hither to London
Why with some little train
Marry
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
Where every horse bears his commanding rein
I hope the king made peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and true in me.
And so in me; and so
Yet
To no apparent likelihood of breach
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
And so say I.
Then be it so; and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
Madam
To give your censures in this weighty business?
With all our harts.
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
My lord
For
My other self
Towards Ludlow then
Exeunt
SCENE III. London. A street.
Enter two Citizens meeting
Neighbour
I promise you
Hear you the news abroad?
Ay
Bad news
I fear
Enter another Citizen
Neighbours
Give you good morrow
Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
Ay
Then
No
Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
In him there is a hope of government
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
Stood the state so? No
For then this land was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
Why
Better it were they all came by the father
For emulation now
O
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
And were they to be ruled
Come
When clouds appear
When great leaves fall
When the sun sets
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
All may be well; but
Truly
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of fear.
Before the times of change
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by proof
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
But leave it all to God. whither away?
Marry
And so was I: I'll bear you company.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. London. The palace.
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
Last night
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow
I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
But I hear
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
Ay
Why
Grandam
More than my brother: 'Ay
Gloucester
And since
Good faith
In him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young
Why
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
Now
How
Marry
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam
I pray thee
Grandam
His nurse! why
If 'twere not she
A parlous boy: go to
Good madam
Pitchers have ears.
Enter a Messenger
Here comes a messenger. What news?
Such news
How fares the prince?
Well
What is thy news then?
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret
Who hath committed them?
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham.
For what offence?
The sum of all I can
Why or for what these nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me
Ay me
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
Welcome
I see
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd
And being seated
Clean over-blown
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood
And frantic outrage
Or let me die
Come
Madam
I'll go along with you.
You have no cause.
My gracious lady
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
For my part
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Come
Exeunt
ACT III
SCENE I. London. A street.
The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD
Welcome
Welcome
The weary way hath made you melancholy.
No
Have made it tedious
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
Sweet prince
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show; which
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words
God keep you from them
God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
My lord
Enter the Lord Mayor and his train
God bless your grace with health and happy days!
I thank you
I thought my mother
Fie
To tell us whether they will come or no!
Enter HASTINGS
And
Welcome
On what occasion
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace
Fie
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently?
If she deny
My Lord of Buckingham
Can from his mother win the Duke of York
To mild entreaties
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
You are too senseless--obstinate
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age
The benefit thereof is always granted
To those whose dealings have deserved the place
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
And therefore
Then
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
My lord
Come on
I go
Good lords
Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
Say
Where it seems best unto your royal self.
If I may counsel you
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
Then where you please
For your best health and recreation.
I do not like the Tower
Did Julius Caesar build that place
He did
Which
Is it upon record
Successively from age to age
Upon record
But say
[Aside]  So wise so young
live long.
What say you
I say
Aside
Thus
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
With what his valour did enrich his wit
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
For now he lives in fame
I'll tell you what
What
An if I live until I be a man
[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
Enter young YORK
Now
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
Well
Ay
Too late he died that might have kept that title
How fares our cousin
I thank you
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
He hath
And therefore is he idle?
O
Then is he more beholding to you than I.
He may command me as my sovereign;
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
I pray you
My dagger
A beggar
Of my kind uncle
And being but a toy
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
A greater gift! O
A gentle cousin
O
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
I weigh it lightly
What
I would
How?
Little.
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
Uncle
You mean
Uncle
Because that I am little
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
So cunning and so young is wonderful.
My lord
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
What
My lord protector needs will have it so.
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
Why
Marry
My grandam told me he was murdered there.
I fear no uncles dead.
Nor none that live
An if they live
But come
A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Think you
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
No doubt
Bold
He is all the mother's
Well
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart:
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind
In the seat royal of this famous isle?
He for his father's sake so loves the prince
What think'st thou
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
Well
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower
If thou dost find him tractable to us
If he be leaden
For we to-morrow hold divided councils
Commend me to Lord William: tell him
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
And bid my friend
Good Catesby
My good lords both
Shall we hear from you
You shall
At Crosby Place
Exit CATESBY
Now
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
Chop off his head
And
The earldom of Hereford
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
Come
We may digest our complots in some form.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Before Lord Hastings' house.
Enter a Messenger
What
[Within]  Who knocks at the door?
A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
Enter HASTINGS
What is't o'clock?
Upon the stroke of four.
Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
So it should seem by that I have to say.
First
And then?
And then he sends you word
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
Besides
And that may be determined at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other.
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure
Go
Bid him not fear the separated councils
His honour and myself are at the one
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
Tell him his fears are shallow
And for his dreams
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
To fly the boar before the boar pursues
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
Go
And we will both together to the Tower
My gracious lord
Exit
Enter CATESBY
Many good morrows to my noble lord!
Good morrow
What news
It is a reeling world
And I believe twill never stand upright
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
Ay
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
Ay
Upon his party for the gain thereof:
And thereupon he sends you this good news
Indeed
But
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence
I live to look upon their tragedy.
I tell thee
What
Ere a fortnight make me elder
'Tis a vile thing to die
O monstrous
With Rivers
With some men else
As thou and I; who
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
The princes both make high account of you;
Aside
For they account his head upon the bridge.
I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
Enter STANLEY
Come on
Fear you the boar
My lord
You may jest on
My lord
And never in my life
Think you
The lords at Pomfret
But yet
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
Pray God
What
Come
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
They
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
But come
Enter a Pursuivant
Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
How now
The better that your lordship please to ask.
I tell thee
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
But now
This day those enemies are put to death
God hold it
Gramercy
Throws him his purse
God save your lordship!
Exit
Enter a Priest
Well met
I thank thee
I am in your debt for your last exercise;
Come the next Sabbath
He whispers in his ear
Enter BUCKINGHAM
What
Your friends at Pomfret
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
Good faith
What
I do
I shall return before your lordship thence.
'Tis like enough
[Aside]  And supper too
Come
I'll wait upon your lordship.
Exeunt
SCENE III. Pomfret Castle.
Enter RATCLIFF
Come
Sir Richard Ratcliff
To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth
God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
You live that shall cry woe for this after.
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
O Pomfret
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
And
Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads
Then cursed she Hastings
To hear her prayers for them
And for my sister and her princely sons
Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
Come
And take our leave
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The Tower of London.
Enter BUCKINGHAM
My lords
Is
In God's name
Are all things fitting for that royal time?
It is
To-morrow
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
Who is most inward with the royal duke?
Your grace
Who
Nor I no more of his
Lord Hastings
I thank his grace
But
I have not sounded him
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
But you
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice
Enter GLOUCESTER
Now in good time
My noble lords and cousins all
I have been long a sleeper; but
Had not you come upon your cue
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part
I mean
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
His lordship knows me well
I thank your grace.
My lord of Ely!
My lord?
When I was last in Holborn
I do beseech you send for some of them.
Marry
Exit
Cousin of Buckingham
Drawing him aside
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business
His master's son
Withdraw you hence
Exit GLOUCESTER
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
To-morrow
For I myself am not so well provided
As else I would be
Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY
Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
strawberries.
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
There's some conceit or other likes him well
I think there's never a man in Christendom
That can less hide his love or hate than he;
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
What of his heart perceive you in his face
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
Marry
For
I pray God he be not
Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
I pray you all
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Of damned witchcraft
Upon my body with their hellish charms?
The tender love I bear your grace
To doom the offenders
I say
Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
Is
And this is Edward's wife
If they have done this thing
If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
Off with his head! Now
Lovel and Ratcliff
The rest
Exeunt all but HASTINGS
Woe
For I
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
But I disdain'd it
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble
O
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies
O Margaret
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
Dispatch
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
O momentary grace of mortal men
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
Come
O bloody Richard! miserable England!
I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
Come
They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.
Exeunt

Lord mayor
Look to the drawbridge there!
Hark! a drum.
Catesby
Lord mayor
Look back
God and our innocency defend and guard us!
Be patient
Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor
So dear I loved the man
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
Well
That ever lived.
Would you imagine
This day had plotted
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
What
What
Or that we would
Now
And you my good lords
I never look'd for better at his hands
Yet had not we determined he should die
Which now the loving haste of these our friends
Because
The traitor speak
The manner and the purpose of his treason;
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
But
And doubt you not
With all your just proceedings in this cause.
And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here
But since you come too late of our intents
And so
Exit Lord Mayor
Go
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
There
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house
Moreover
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Which stretched to their servants
Nay
Tell them
Of that unsatiate Edward
My princely father then had wars in France
And
Which well appeared in his lineaments
But touch this sparingly
Fear not
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself: and so
If you thrive well
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
I go: and towards three or four o'clock
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
Exit BUCKINGHAM
Go
To CATESBY
Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Now will I in
And to give notice
At any time have recourse unto the princes.
Exit
SCENE VI. The same.
Enter a Scrivener
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hours I spent to write it over
The precedent was full as long a-doing:
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross
Yet who's so blind
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought
Exit
SCENE VII. Baynard's Castle.
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
How now
Now
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy
The insatiate greediness of his desires
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy
Withal I did infer your lineaments
Laid open all your victories in Scotland
Indeed
Untouch'd
And when mine oratory grew to an end
I bid them that did love their country's good
Cry 'God save Richard
Ah! and did they so?
No
But
Which when I saw
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
His answer was
To be spoke to but by the recorder.
Then he was urged to tell my tale again
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
When he had done
And thus I took the vantage of those few
'This general applause and loving shout
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
And even here brake off
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
No
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
Be not you spoke with
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
And be not easily won to our request:
Play the maid's part
I go; and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself
Go
Exit GLOUCESTER
Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
Enter CATESBY
Here comes his servant: how now
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
To visit him to-morrow or next day:
He is within
And no worldly suit would he be moved
Return
Tell him
I'll tell him what you say
Exit
Ah
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans
Not sleeping
Happy were England
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
But
Marry
I fear he will.
Re-enter CATESBY
How now
My lord
Such troops of citizens to speak with him
My lord
Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me
By heaven
And so once more return and tell his grace.
Exit CATESBY
When holy and devout religious men
Are at their beads
Enter GLOUCESTER aloft
See
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince
And
Famous Plantagenet
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
My lord
I rather do beseech you pardon me
But
Even that
I do suspect I have done some offence
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes
You have
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
Then know
The supreme seat
Whilst
Her face defaced with scars of infamy
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
Which to recure
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
And kingly government of this your land
But as successively from blood to blood
For this
I know not whether to depart in silence
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer
Tongue-tied ambition
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
If to reprove you for this suit of yours
Then
Therefore
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request.
First if all obstacles were cut away
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit
But
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
On him I lay what you would lay on me
Which God defend that I should wring from him!
My lord
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial
You say that Edward is your brother's son:
So say we too
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
To Bona
These both put by a poor petitioner
To base declension and loathed bigamy
By her
This Edward
More bitterly could I expostulate
Then
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
If non to bless us and the land withal
From the corruption of abusing times
Do
Refuse not
O
Alas
I am unfit for state and majesty;
I do beseech you
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
If you refuse it
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle
Yet whether you accept our suit or no
But we will plant some other in the throne
And in this resolution here we leave you.--
Come
O
Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens
Call them again
Do
Would you enforce me to a world of care?
Well
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest
Cousin of Buckingham
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
Attend the sequel of your imposition
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
For God he knows
God bless your grace! we see it
In saying so
Then I salute you with this kingly title:
Long live Richard
Amen.
To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
Even when you please
To-morrow
And so most joyfully we take our leave.
Come
Farewell
Exeunt

Who m eets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?

God give your graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day!

No farther than the Tower; and
Kind sister
Enter BRAKENBURY
And
Master lieutenant
Right well
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
The king! why
I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
Their aunt I am in law
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
And take thy office from thee
No
I am bound by oath
Exit
Enter LORD STANLEY
Let me but meet you
To LADY ANNE
Come
O
May have some scope to beat
With this dead-killing news!
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
Be of good cheer: mother
O Dorset
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
If thou wilt outstrip death
Go
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse
Full of wise care is this your counsel
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
You shall have letters from me to my son
To meet you on the way
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
O my accursed womb
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world
Come
And I in all unwillingness will go.
I would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Were red-hot steel
Anointed let me be with deadly venom
Go
To feed my humour
No! why?  When he that is my husband now
Came to me
Which issued from my other angel husband
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
O
And
And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
As miserable by the life of thee
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
Lo
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse
For never yet one hour in his bed
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep
Besides
And will
Poor heart
No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
Farewell
Adieu
[To DORSET]
Go thou to Richmond
To LADY ANNE
Go thou to Richard
To QUEEN ELIZABETH
Go thou to sanctuary
I to my grave
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen
Stay
Pity
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
Rude ragged nurse
For tender princes
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
Exeunt
SCENE II. London. The palace.
Sennet. Enter KING RICHARD III
Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
My gracious sovereign?
Give me thy hand.
Here he ascendeth his throne
Thus high
And thy assistance
But shall we wear these honours for a day?
Or shall they last
Still live they and for ever may they last!
O Buckingham
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
Say on
Why
Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
TRUE
O bitter consequence
Cousin
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.
Your grace may do your pleasure.
Tut
Say
Give me some breath
Before I positively herein:
I will resolve your grace immediately.
Exit
[Aside to a stander by]
The king is angry: see
I will converse with iron-witted fools
And unrespective boys: none are for me
That look into me with considerate eyes:
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
Boy!
My lord?
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
My lord
Gold were as good as twenty orators
What is his name?
His name
I partly know the man: go

No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
Hath he so long held out with me untired
Enter STANLEY
How now! what news with you?
My lord
To Richmond
Where he abides.
Stands apart
Catesby!
My lord?
Rumour it abroad
That Anne
I will take order for her keeping close.
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman
The boy is foolish
Look
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
About it; for it stands me much upon
Exit CATESBY
I must be married to my brother's daughter
Murder her brothers
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

Is thy name Tyrrel?
James Tyrrel
Art thou
Prove me
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
Ay
But I had rather kill two enemies.

Let me have open means to come to them
Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark
Go
Whispers
There is no more but so: say it is done
'Tis done
Shall we hear from thee
Ye shall

Re-enter BUCKINGHAM
My Lord
The late demand that you did sound me in.
Well
I hear that news
Stanley
My lord
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
The which you promised I should possess.
Stanley
Letters to Richmond
What says your highness to my just demand?
As I remember
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king
A king
My lord!
How chance the prophet could not at that time
Have told me
My lord
Richmond! When last I was at Exeter
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
My Lord!
Ay
I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
Of what you promised me.
Well
Upon the stroke of ten.
Well
Why let it strike?
Because that
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
I am not in the giving vein to-day.
Why
Tut
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM
Is it even so? rewards he my true service
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
O
To Brecknock
Exit
SCENE III. The same.
Enter TYRREL
The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
The most arch of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest
To do this ruthless piece of butchery
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
'Lo
'Thus
Within their innocent alabaster arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once
But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
The most replenished sweet work of nature
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I left them both
And here he comes.
Enter KING RICHARD III
All hail
Kind Tyrrel
If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness
But didst thou see them dead?
I did
And buried
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
But how or in what place I do not know.
Come to me
Meantime
Farewell till soon.
Exit TYRREL
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom
Now
At young Elizabeth
Enter CATESBY
My lord!
Good news or bad
Bad news
And Buckingham
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
Come
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
Then fiery expedition be my wing
Come
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Before the palace.
Enter QUEEN MARGARET
So
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
A dire induction am I witness to
Will prove as bitter
Withdraw thee
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
Ah
My unblown flowers
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual
And hear your mother's lamentation!
Hover about her; say
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
So many miseries have crazed my voice
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
Wilt thou
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
When holy Harry died
Blind sight
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
O
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
Then would I hide my bones
O
Sitting down by her
If ancient sorrow be most reverend
If sorrow can admit society
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
I had an Edward
I had a Harry
Thou hadst an Edward
Thou hadst a Richard
I had a Richard too
I had a Rutland too
Thou hadst a Clarence too
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
That dog
O upright
Preys on the issue of his mother's body
O Harry's wife
God witness with me
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge
Thy Edward he is dead
Thy other Edward dead
Young York he is but boot
Match not the high perfection of my loss:
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
And the beholders of this tragic play
Richard yet lives
And send them thither: but at hand
Earth gapes
To have him suddenly convey'd away.
Cancel his bond of life
O
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
That bottled spider
I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
I call'd thee then poor shadow
The presentation of but what I was;
The flattering index of a direful pageant;
One heaved a-high
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
A dream of what thou wert
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
Decline all this
For happy wife
For joyful mother
For queen
For one being sued to
For one that scorn'd at me
For one being fear'd of all
For one commanding all
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about
Having no more but thought of what thou wert
Thou didst usurp my place
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
From which even here I slip my weary neck
Farewell
These English woes will make me smile in France.
O thou well skill'd in curses
Forbear to sleep the nights
Compare dead happiness with living woe;
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
My words are dull; O
Thy woes will make them sharp
Exit
Why should calamity be full of words?
Windy attorneys to their client woes
Let them have scope: though what they do impart
Help not all
If so
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
My damned son
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
Enter KING RICHARD III
Who intercepts my expedition?
O
From all the slaughters
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown
Tell me
Thou toad
And little Ned Plantagenet
Where is kind Hastings
A flourish
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike
Flourish. Alarums
Either be patient
Thus will I drown your exclamations.
Art thou my son?
Ay
Then patiently hear my impatience.
Madam
O
Do then: but I'll not hear.
I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
And brief
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee
And came I not at last to comfort you?
No
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
Thy school-days frightful
What comfortable hour canst thou name
Faith
your grace
To breakfast once forth of my company.
If I be so disgracious in your sight
Strike the drum.
I prithee
You speak too bitterly.
Hear me a word;
For I shall never speak to thee again.
So.
Either thou wilt die
And never look upon thy face again.
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
Which
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
My prayers on the adverse party fight;
And there the little souls of Edward's children
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory.
Bloody thou art
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
Exit
Though far more cause
Abides in me; I say amen to all.
Stay
I have no more sons of the royal blood
For thee to murder: for my daughters
And therefore level not to hit their lives.
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth
And must she die for this? O
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
Throw over her the veil of infamy:
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter
Wrong not her birth
To save her life
Her life is only safest in her birth.
And only in that safety died her brothers.
Lo
No
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
TRUE
My babes were destined to a fairer death
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
Cousins
Of comfort
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
And I
Madam
And dangerous success of bloody wars
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven
The advancement of your children
Up to some scaffold
No
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
Tell me what state
Even all I have; yea
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
Be brief
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
Then know
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
What do you think?
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
I mean
Say then
Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
What
I
How canst thou woo her?
That would I learn of you
And wilt thou learn of me?
Madam
Send to her
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
Did to thy father
A handkerchief; which
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
If this inducement force her not to love
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence
Come
To win our daughter.
There is no other way
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
Say that I did all this for love of her.
Nay
Look
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
If I did take the kingdom from your sons
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
A grandam's name is little less in love
Than is the doting title of a mother;
They are as children but one step below
Of an one pain
Endured of her
Your children were vexation to your youth
The loss you have is but a son being king
I cannot make you what amends I would
Dorset your son
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil
To high promotions and great dignity:
The king
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Again shall you be mother to a king
Repair'd with double riches of content.
What! we have many goodly days to see:
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again
Of ten times double gain of happiness.
Go
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
The petty rebel
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
To whom I will retail my conquest won
What were I best to say? her father's brother
Would be her lord? or shall I say
Or
Under what title shall I woo for thee
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
Say that the king
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
Say
To wail the tide
Say
But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
Say
But she
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
O no
Too deep and dead
Harp not on that string
Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
Now
Profaned
I swear--
By nothing; for this is no oath:
The George
The garter
The crown
if something thou wilt swear to be believed
Now
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
My father's death--
Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
Then
Thyself thyself misusest.
Why then
God's wrong is most of all.
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him
Had not been broken
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him
What canst thou swear by now?
The time to come.
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
For I myself have many tears to wash
Hereafter time
The children live
slaughter'd
The parents live
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
Misused ere used
As I intend to prosper and repent
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
Day
Be opposite all planets of good luck
To my proceedings
In her consists my happiness and thine;
Without her
It cannot be avoided but by this;
It will not be avoided but by this.
Therefore
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Plead what I will be
Not my deserts
Urge the necessity and state of times
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
Ay
Shall I forget myself to be myself?
Ay
But thou didst kill my children.
But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
Selves of themselves
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
And be a happy mother by the deed.
I go. Write to me very shortly.
And you shall understand from me her mind.
Bear her my true love's kiss; and so

And who is England's king but great York's heir?
Then
Unless for that
Unless for that he comes to be your liege
Thou wilt revolt
No
Where is thy power
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
Are they not now upon the western shore.
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
No
Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north
They have not been commanded
Please it your majesty to give me leave
Where and what time your majesty shall please.
Ay
I will not trust you
Most mighty sovereign
I never was nor never will be false.
Well

Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
Such proclamation hath been made

This is the day that
False to his children or his wife's allies
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
By the false faith of him I trusted most;
This
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
That high All-Seer that I dallied with
Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:

Enter RICHMOND
Fellows in arms
Have we march'd on without impediment;
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched
In your embowell'd bosoms
Lies now even in the centre of this isle
From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
In God's name
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
Every man's conscience is a thousand swords
I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
All for our vantage. Then
True hope is swift
Kings it makes gods
Exeunt
SCENE III. Bosworth Field.
Enter KING RICHARD III in arms
Here pitch our tents
My Lord of Surrey
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
My Lord of Norfolk
Here
Norfolk
We must both give and take
Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
But where to-morrow?  Well
Who hath descried the number of the foe?
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
Why
Besides
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen
Call for some men of sound direction
Let's want no discipline
Exeunt
Enter
The weary sun hath made a golden set
Sir William Brandon
Give me some ink and paper in my tent
I'll draw the form and model of our battle
My Lord of Oxford
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
Good Captain Blunt
And by the second hour in the morning
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
Yet one thing more
Unless I have mista'en his colours much
South from the mighty power of the king.
If without peril it be possible
Upon my life
And so
Good night
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
They withdraw into the tent
Enter
What is't o'clock?
It's supper-time
It's nine o'clock.
I will not sup to-night.
Give me some ink and paper.
What
And all my armour laid into my tent?
If is
Good Norfolk
Use careful watch
I go
Stir with the lark to-morrow
I warrant you
Exit
Catesby!
My lord?
Send out a pursuivant at arms
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
Before sunrising
Into the blind cave of eternal night.
Exit CATESBY
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
Look that my staves be sound
Ratcliff!
My lord?
Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
Thomas the Earl of Surrey
Went through the army
So
I have not that alacrity of spirit
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
It is
Bid my guard watch; leave me.
Ratcliff
And help to arm me. Leave me
Exeunt RATCLIFF and the other Attendants
Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent
Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
All comfort that the dark night can afford
Be to thy person
Tell me
I
Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
So much for that. The silent hours steal on
In brief
Prepare thy battle early in the morning
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
I
With best advantage will deceive the time
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
Once more
Good lords
I'll strive
Once more
Exeunt all but RICHMOND
O Thou
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
Make us thy ministers of chastisement
To thee I do commend my watchful soul

The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee
Good angels guard thy battle! live

Let us be led within thy bosom
Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die!

Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!

Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.
Enter the Ghost of LADY ANNE

To RICHMOND
Thou quiet soul
Dream of success and happy victory!
Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.
Enter the Ghost of BUCKINGHAM
Ghost
[To KING RICHARD III]
The last was I that helped thee to the crown;
The last was I that felt thy tyranny:
O
Dream on
Fainting
To RICHMOND
I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:
But cheer thy heart
God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;
And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
The Ghosts vanish
KING RICHARD III starts out of his dream
Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
Have mercy
O coward conscience
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
Richard loves Richard; that is
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes
Then fly. What
Lest I revenge. What
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
That I myself have done unto myself?
O
For hateful deeds committed by myself!
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
Fool
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues
Perjury
Murder
All several sins
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
And if I die
Nay
Find in myself no pity to myself?
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
Enter RATCLIFF
My lord!
'Zounds! who is there?
Ratcliff
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
Your friends are up
O Ratcliff
What thinkest thou
No doubt
O Ratcliff
Nay
By the apostle Paul
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof
It is not yet near day. Come
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper
Exeunt
Enter the Lords to RICHMOND
Good morrow
Cry mercy
How have you slept
The sweetest sleep
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head
Methought their souls
I promise you
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
How far into the morning is it
Upon the stroke of four.
Why
His oration to his soldiers
More than I have said
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
Richard except
Had rather have us win than him they follow:
For what is he they follow?  truly
One raised in blood
One that made means to come by what he hath
Abase foul stone
Of England's chair
One that hath ever been God's enemy:
Then
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down
If you do fight against your country's foes
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives
If you do free your children from the sword
Then
For me
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
But if I thrive
The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!
Exeunt
Re-enter KING RICHARD
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
That he was never trained up in arms.
He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
Clock striketh
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
Who saw the sun to-day?
Not I
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
He should have braved the east an hour ago
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
My lord?
The sun will not be seen to-day;
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
Not shine to-day! Why
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
Enter NORFOLK
Arm
Come
Call up Lord Stanley
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk
They thus directed
In the main battle
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
This
A good direction
This found I on my tent this morning.
He sheweth him a paper
[Reads]
'Jockey of Norfolk
A thing devised by the enemy.
Go
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:
Conscience is but a word that cowards use
Our strong arms be our conscience
March on
If not to heaven
His oration to his Army
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
Remember whom you are to cope withal;
A sort of vagabonds
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
You sleeping safe
You having lands
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
A milk-sop
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
Lash hence these overweening rags of France
Who
If we be conquer'd
Have in their own land beaten
Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?
Ravish our daughters?
Drum afar off
Hark! I hear their drum.
Fight
Draw
Spur your proud horses hard
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
Enter a Messenger
What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?
My lord
Off with his son George's head!
My lord
After the battle let George Stanley die.
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
Advance our standards
Our ancient word of courage
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

Courageous Richmond
Lo
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I pluck'd off
Wear it
Great God of heaven
But
He is
Whither
What men of name are slain on either side?
John Duke of Norfolk
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submission will return to us:
And then
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
What traitor hears me
England hath long been mad
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood
All this divided York and Lancaster
And let their heirs
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace
Abate the edge of traitors
Let them not live to taste this land's increase
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
Now civil wounds are stopp'd
That she may long live here

ACT I
PROLOGUE
Two households
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love
The which if you with patient ears attend
SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY
Gregory
No
I mean
Ay
I strike quickly
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore
A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.
True; and therefore women
Montague's men from the wall
to the wall.
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
'Tis all one
have fought with the men
maids
The heads of the maids?
Ay
take it in what sense thou wilt.
They must take it in sense that feel it.
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the house of the Montagues.
My naked weapon is out: quarrel
How! turn thy back and run?
Fear me not.
No
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
I will frown as I pass by
they list.
Nay
which is a disgrace to them
Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
Do you bite your thumb at us
I do bite my thumb
Do you bite your thumb at us
[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side
ay?
No.
No

Do you quarrel
Quarrel sir! no
If you do
No better.
Well
Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
Yes
You lie.

Thou villain Capulet
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
Enter PRINCE
Rebellious subjects
Will they not hear? What
With purple fountains issuing from your veins
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground
Three civil brawls
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
If ever you disturb our streets again
For this time
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
And
Once more
Exeunt all but MONTAGUE
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak
Here were the servants of your adversary
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
O
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
Madam
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east
Where
That westward rooteth from the city's side
Towards him I made
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I
Many a morning hath he there been seen
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove
My noble uncle
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
Have you importuned him by any means?
Both by myself and many other friends:
But he
But to himself so secret and so close
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.
Enter ROMEO
See
I'll know his grievance
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
Good-morrow
Is the day so young?
But new struck nine.
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that
In love?
Out--
Of love?
Out of her favour
Alas
Alas
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not
Here's much to do with hate
Why
O any thing
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead
Still-waking sleep
This love feel I
Dost thou not laugh?
No
Good heart
At thy good heart's oppression.
Why
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet
Farewell
Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so
Tut
This is not Romeo
Tell me in sadness
What
Groan! why
But sadly tell me who.
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah
In sadness
I aim'd so near
A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
A right fair mark
Well
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
O
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair
She hath forsworn to love
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
Be ruled by me
O
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
I'll pay that doctrine
Exeunt
SCENE II. A street.
Enter CAPULET
But Montague is bound as well as I
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she
But woo her
An she agree
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all
Which on more view
May stand in number
To Servant
Go
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there

Rest you merry!

At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest
Go thither; and

God forbid! Where's this girl? What
Enter JULIET
How now! who calls?
Your mother.
Madam
What is your will?
This is the matter:--Nurse
I have remember'd me
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Faith
She's not fourteen.
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth
And yet
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?
A fortnight and odd days.
Even or odd
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well
She was too good for me: but
That shall she
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd
Of all the days of the year
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay
Of my dug and felt it bitter
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay
For even the day before
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Yea
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not
To see
I warrant
And
Enough of this; I pray thee
Yes
And yet
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not
And stint thou too
Peace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once
Marry
I came to talk of. Tell me
It is an honour that I dream not of.
An honour! were not I thine only nurse
Well
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
A man
As all the world--why
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Nay
What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
Examine every married lineament
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love
The fish lives in the sea
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory
So shall you share all that he doth possess
No less! nay
Speak briefly
I'll look to like
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

SCENE IV. A street.
Enter ROMEO
What
Or shall we on without a apology?
The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf
Nor no without-book prologue
After the prompter
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy
Nay
Not I
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
And
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Is love a tender thing? it is too rough
If love be rough with you
Prick love for pricking
Give me a case to put my visage in:
A visor for a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
Come
A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
I'll be a candle-holder
The game was ne'er so fair
Tut
If thou art dun
Of this sir-reverence love
Up to the ears. Come
Nay
I mean
We waste our lights in vain
Take our good meaning
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.
Why
I dream'd a dream to-night.
And so did I.
Well
That dreamers often lie.
In bed asleep
O
She is the fairies' midwife
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains
O'er courtiers' knees
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck
Drums in his ear
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night
This is the hag
This is she--
Peace
Thou talk'st of nothing.
TRUE
And more inconstant than the wind
Even now the frozen bosom of the north
This wind
Supper is done
I fear
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.

Welcome
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.

Welcome
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
You are welcome
A hall
Music plays
More light
Ah
Nay
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?
By'r lady
What
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio
'Tis more
His son is thirty.
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.
[To a Servingman]  What lady is that
enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?
I know not
O
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
The measure done
Did my heart love till now? forswear it
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
This
Fetch me my rapier
Come hither
Now
Why
Uncle
Young Romeo is it?
'Tis he
Content thee
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient
It is my will
It fits
I'll not endure him.
He shall be endured:
What
Am I the master here
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
Why
Go to
You are a saucy boy: is't so
This trick may chance to scathe you
You must contrary me! marry
Well said
Be quiet
I'll make you quiet. What
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
Exit
[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine
My lips
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Good pilgrim
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch
Have not saints lips
Ay
O
They pray
Saints do not move
Then move not
Thus from my lips
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.
You kiss by the book.
Madam
What is her mother?
Marry
I nursed her daughter
I tell you
Shall have the chinks.
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
Away
Ay
Nay
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why
I thank you
More torches here! Come on then
Ah
I'll to my rest.
Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
Come hither
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
What's he that now is going out of door?
Marry
What's he that follows there
I know not.
Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
His name is Romeo
The only son of your great enemy.
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
What's this? what's this?
A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.
One calls within 'Juliet.'
Anon
Come
Exeunt
ACT II
PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again
Being held a foe
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
Exit
SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
Enter ROMEO
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back
He climbs the wall
Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
He is wise;
And
He ran this way
Call
Nay
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
He heareth not
The ape is dead
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie
And if he hear thee
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest
I conjure only but to raise up him.
Come
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
If love be blind
Now will he sit under a medlar tree
As maids call medlars
Romeo
An open et caetera
Romeo
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come

To seek him here that means not to be found.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
Enter ROMEO
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
JULIET appears above at a window
But
It is the east
Arise
Be not her maid
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady
O
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See
O
Ay me!
She speaks:
O
As glorious to this night
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
O Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or
[Aside]  Shall I hear more
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself
What's Montague? it is nor hand
Belonging to a man. O
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would
Without that title. Romeo
Take all myself.
I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name
Had I it written
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Neither
How camest thou hither
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
If they do see thee
Alack
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me
My life were better ended by their hate
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
By love
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st
Then say
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won
In truth
But trust me
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange
Lady
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
O
What shall I swear by?
Do not swear at all;
Or
If my heart's dear love--
Well
It is too rash
Too like the lightning
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet
This bud of love
Good night
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
O
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose
But to be frank
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea
Nurse calls within
I hear some noise within; dear love
Anon
Stay but a little
Exit
O blessed
Being in night
Re-enter JULIET
Three words
If that thy bent of love be honourable
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within]  Madam!
I come
[Within]  Madam!
By and by
To cease thy suit
To-morrow will I send.
So thrive my soul--
A thousand times good night!
Exit
A thousand times the worse
Love goes toward love

Retiring
Re-enter JULIET
Hist! Romeo
Bondage is hoarse
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night
Romeo!
My dear?
At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?
At the hour of nine.
I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
I shall forget
And I'll still stay
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand
I would I were thy bird.
Sweet
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night
sweet sorrow
Exit above
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes
Would I were sleep and peace
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell
Exit
SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb
We sucking on her natural bosom find
O
In herbs
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give
Revolts from true birth
Virtue itself turns vice
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this
Being tasted
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs
And where the worser is predominant
Enter ROMEO
Good morrow
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
With Rosaline
I have forgot that name
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
I'll tell thee
I have been feasting with mine enemy
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred
Be plain
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers
And all combined
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met
Holy Saint Francis
Is Rosaline
Not truly in their hearts
Jesu Maria
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
Lo
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
For doting
And bad'st me bury love.
Not in a grave
I pray thee
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.
O
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
But come
For this alliance may so happy prove
O
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Exeunt
SCENE IV. A street.

Came he not home to-night?
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Ah
Torments him so
Tybalt
A challenge
Romeo will answer it.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Nay
dares
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?
Why
More than prince of cats
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song
proportion; rests me his minim rest
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
button
very first house
ah
hai!

fairly last night.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

Pardon
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
That's as much as to say
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

Thou hast most kindly hit it.
A most courteous exposition.

Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
Nay
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.
And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
O here's a wit of cheveril
inch narrow to an ell broad!
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose
Why
now art thou sociable
thou what thou art
for this drivelling love is like a great natural
Stop there
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

You say well.
Yea

She will indite him to some supper.

What wilt thou tell her
I will tell her
I take it
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
No truly sir; not a penny.
Go to; I say you shall.
This afternoon
And stay
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you
What say'st thou
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say
I warrant thee
Well
is a nobleman in town

How art thou out of breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good
Say either
Let me be satisfied
Well

Here's such a coil! come
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
I have.
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
Hie you to church; I must another way
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:

That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words
It is enough I may but call her mine.
These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Enter JULIET
Here comes the lady: O
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
Romeo shall thank thee
As much to him
Ah
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it
This neighbour air
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
Conceit
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

it on the drawer
Am I like such a fellow?
Come

And what to?
Nay
shortly
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
The fee-simple! O simple!

Romeo that spoke him fair
How nice the quarrel was
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath
Of Tybalt deaf to peace
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast
Cold death aside
It back to Tybalt
his tongue
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio
But by and by comes back to Romeo
Could draw to part them
And
This is the truth
He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
I beg for justice
Romeo slew Tybalt
Romeo slew him
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
Not Romeo
His fault concludes but what the law should end
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence:
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste
Bear hence this body and attend our will:
Mercy but murders

Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come

To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O

Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
Ah
We are undone
Alack the day! he's gone
Can heaven be so envious?
Romeo can
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
What devil art thou
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I
Or those eyes shut
If he be slain
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
I saw the wound
God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse
Pale
O
To prison
Vile earth
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
O Tybalt
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd
My dear-loved cousin
Then
For who is living
Tybalt is gone
Romeo that kill'd him
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
It did
O serpent heart
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st
O nature
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!
There's no trust
Ah
These griefs
Shame come to Romeo!
Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah
But
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back
Your tributary drops belong to woe
My husband lives
And Tybalt's dead
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was
But
'Tybalt is dead
That 'banished
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough
Or
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs

But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death
There is no end
Where is my father
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent
Take up those cords: poor ropes
He made you for a highway to my bed;

Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company:
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips
Ha
For exile hath more terror in his look
Hence from Verona art thou banished:
Be patient
There is no world without Verona walls
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince
This is dear mercy
'Tis torture
And little mouse
But Romeo may not: more validity
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this
They are free men
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd
O friar
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart
Thou fond mad man
O
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
Adversity's sweet milk
Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!

With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
O
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up
As if that name
Murder'd her kinsman. O
Doth my name lodge? tell me
The hateful mansion.
Drawing his sword
Hold thy desperate hand:
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee
Why rail'st thou on thy birth
Since birth
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie
Which
Which should bedeck thy shape
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
Thy wit
What
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But
Take heed
Go
But look thou stay not till the watch be set
Where thou shalt live
To blaze your marriage
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go before
And bid her hasten all the house to bed
Romeo is coming.
O Lord
To hear good counsel: O
My lord
Do so
Here
Hie you
Exit
How well my comfort is revived by this!
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man
Every good hap to you that chances here:
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
But that a joy past joy calls out on me
Exeunt
SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
Enter CAPULET
Things have fall'n out
Look you
'Tis very late
I promise you
These times of woe afford no time to woo.
Madam
I will
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
Sir Paris
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay
Wife
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her
But
Monday
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado
For
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends
My lord
Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed
Farewell
Afore me! it is so very very late
Good night.
Exeunt
SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
Enter ROMEO and JULIET above
Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me
It was the lark
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live
Yon light is not day-light
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
Let me be ta'en
I am content
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye
Nor that is not the lark
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come
How is't
It is
It is the lark that sings so out of tune
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
Enter Nurse
Madam!
Nurse?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary
Exit
Then
Farewell
He goeth down
Art thou gone so? love
I must hear from thee every day in the hour
O
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
O God
Methinks I see thee
Either my eyesight fails
And trust me
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu
Exit
O fortune
If thou art fickle
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle
For then
[Within]         Ho
Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
Enter LADY CAPULET
Why
Madam
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What
An if thou couldst
Therefore
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
So shall you feel the loss
Which you weep for.
Feeling so the loss
Well
What villain madam?
That same villain
[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
God Pardon him! I do
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
That is
Ay
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
We will have vengeance for it
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua
And then
Indeed
With Romeo
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam
To bear a poison
That Romeo should
To hear him named
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
Find thou the means
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings
And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they
Well
One who
Madam
Marry
Now
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he
I pray you
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself
Enter CAPULET and Nurse
When the sun sets
But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.
How now! a conduit
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark
For still thy eyes
Who
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
Ay
I would the fool were married to her grave!
Soft! take me with you
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
Not proud
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate
How now
'Proud
And yet 'not proud
Out
You tallow-face!
Fie
Good father
Hang thee
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday
Speak not
My fingers itch. Wife
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much
Out on her
God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame
And why
I speak no treason.
O
May not one speak?
Peace
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need it not.
You are too hot.
God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage
And then to have a wretched puling fool
But
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
Look to't
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart
An you be mine
And you be not
the streets
Trust to't
Exit
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
O
Delay this marriage for a month
Or
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
Talk not to me
Do as thou wilt
Exit
O God!--O nurse
My husband is on earth
How shall that faith return again to earth
By leaving earth? comfort me
Alack
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort
Faith
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
Or
Then
O
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart
Speakest thou from thy heart?
And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.
Amen!
What?
Well
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone
Marry
Exit
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar
If all else fail
Exit
ACT IV
SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
On Thursday
My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Uneven is the course
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway
Which
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
Look
Enter JULIET
Happily met
That may be
That may be must be
What must be shall be.
That's a certain text.
Come you to make confession to this father?
To answer that
Do not deny to him that you love me.
I will confess to you that I love him.
So will ye
If I do so
Poor soul
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.
Thou wrong'st it
That is no slander
And what I spake
Thy face is mine
It may be so
Are you at leisure
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
My leisure serves me
My lord
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Juliet
Till then
Exit
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so
Ah
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
I hear thou must
Tell me not
If
God join'd my heart and Romeo's
And ere this hand
Turn to another
Therefore
Shall play the umpire
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die
Hold
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If
A thing like death to chide away this shame
And
O
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that
And I will do it without fear or doubt
Hold
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Take thou this vial
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour
Shall keep his native progress
No warmth
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes
Each part
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
Now
To rouse thee from thy bed
Then
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the mean time
Will watch thy waking
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
If no inconstant toy
Give me
Hold; get you gone
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
To Mantua
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell

So many guests invite as here are writ.

Sirrah
You shall have none ill

How canst thou try them so?
Marry
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
fingers goes not with me.
Go
Exit Second Servant
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
What
Ay
Well
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
Enter JULIET
How now
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might
Why
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay
Now
Nurse
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
No

Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light

So please you
For
Good night:
Get thee to bed
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No
Laying down her dagger
What if it be a poison
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead
I fear it is: and yet
How if
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not
Or
As in a vault
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Tybalt
Alack
O
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And
O
Seeking out Romeo
Upon a rapier's point: stay

Spare not for the cost.

For this night's watching.
No
All night for lesser cause

O lamentable day!
What is the matter?
Look
O me
Help
Enter CAPULET
For shame
She's dead
Alack the day
Ha! let me see her: out
Her blood is settled
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
O lamentable day!
O woful time!
Death
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
Come
Ready to go
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies
Death is my son-in-law
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die
Have I thought long to see this morning's face
Accursed
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one
O woe! O woful
Most lamentable day
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day
Beguiled
Most detestable death
O love! O life! not life
Despised
Uncomfortable time
To murder
O child! O child! my soul
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.
Peace
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all
Your part in her you could not keep from death
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
And weep ye now
Above the clouds
O
She's not well married that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears
On this fair corse; and
For though fond nature bids us an lament
All things that we ordained festival
Our instruments to melancholy bells
Sir
And go
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

What will you give us?
No money
I will give you the minstrel.
Then I will give you the serving-creature.
Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you
An you re us and fa us
Pray you
Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
with an iron wit
me like men:
'When griping grief the heart doth wound
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
sound'? What say you
Marry
Pretty! What say you
I say 'silver sound
Pretty too! What say you
Faith
O
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound
because musicians have no gold for sounding:
'Then music with her silver sound
With speedy help doth lend redress.'

ACT V
SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
Enter ROMEO
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream
to think!--
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd
Enter BALTHASAR
News from Verona!--How now
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill
Then she is well
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
O
Is it even so? then I defy you
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper
I do beseech you
Your looks are pale and wild
Some misadventure.
Tush
Leave me
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
No
No matter: get thee gone
Exit BALTHASAR
Well
Let's see for means: O mischief
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary
And hereabouts he dwells
In tatter'd weeds
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes
Noting this penury
'An if a man did need a poison now
O
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember
Being holiday
What
Enter Apothecary
Who calls so loud?
Come hither
Hold
A dram of poison
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Is death to any he that utters them.
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor
My poverty
I pay thy poverty
Put this in any liquid thing you will
Of twenty men
There is thy gold
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food
Come
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
Enter FRIAR JOHN
Holy Franciscan friar! brother
Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
Or
Going to find a bare-foot brother out
One of our order
Where the infectious pestilence did reign
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
Who bare my letter
I could not send it
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood
Of dear import
May do much danger. Friar John
Get me an iron crow
Unto my cell.
Brother
Exit
Now must I to the monument alone;
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua
Poor living corse
Exit
SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
Enter PARIS
Give me thy torch
Yet put it out
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee
[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
Retires
Sweet flower
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
The Page whistles
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
What with a torch! muffle me
Retires
Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life
Why I descend into this bed of death
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring
In dear employment: therefore hence
But if thou
In what I further shall intend to do
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
I will be gone
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live
[Aside]  For all this same
His looks I fear
Retires
Thou detestable maw
Opens the tomb
This is that banish'd haughty Montague
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
Comes forward
Stop thy unhallow'd toil
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain
Obey
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth
Fly hence
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee
By heaven
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not
I do defy thy conjurations
Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee
They fight
O Lord
Exit
O
Falls
If thou be merciful
Dies
In faith
Mercutio's kinsman
What said my man
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death
Laying PARIS in the tomb
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
Tybalt
O
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me
That unsubstantial death is amorous
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O
Will I set up my everlasting rest
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes
Arms
The doors of breath
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come
Thou desperate pilot
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
Drinks
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
Dies
Enter
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
Here's one
Bliss be upon you! Tell me
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern
It doth so
Who is it?
Romeo.
How long hath he been there?
Full half an hour.
Go with me to the vault.
I dare not
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
And fearfully did menace me with death
Stay
O
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here
Romeo!
Advances
Alack
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
Enters the tomb
Romeo! O
And steep'd in blood? Ah
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
The lady stirs.
JULIET wakes
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be
Noise within
I hear some noise. Lady
Of death
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
Stay not to question
Come
I dare no longer stay.
Go
Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
What's here? a cup
Poison
O churl! drunk all
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
Kisses him
Thy lips are warm.
[Within]  Lead
Yea
Snatching ROMEO's dagger
This is thy sheath;
Stabs herself
there rust
Falls on ROMEO's body
Enter Watch
This is the place; there
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain
Go
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
Re-enter some of the Watch
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
Hold him in safety
Re-enter others of the Watch
Here is a friar
We took this mattock and this spade from him
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
What misadventure is so early up
Enter CAPULET
What should it be
The people in the street cry Romeo
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
Sovereign
And Romeo dead; and Juliet
Search
Here is a friar
With instruments upon them
These dead men's tombs.
O heavens! O wife
This dagger hath mista'en--for
Is empty on the back of Montague
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
O me! this sight of death is as a bell
Enter MONTAGUE and others
Come
Alas
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?
Look
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
To press before thy father to a grave?
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
I am the greatest
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
And here I stand
Myself condemned and myself excused.
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
I will be brief
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo
And she
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city
You
To County Paris: then comes she to me
To rid her from this second marriage
Then gave I her
As I intended
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo
But he which bore my letter
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
But when I came
Of her awaking
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and
Miscarried by my fault
Be sacrificed
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place
This letter he early bid me give his father
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page
Sirrah
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.
This letter doth make good the friar's words
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary
Came to this vault to die
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
O brother Montague
This is my daughter's jointure
Can I demand.
But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun
Go hence
Some shall be pardon'd
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Exeunt
SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.
Enter Hostess and SLY
I'll pheeze you
A pair of stocks
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
No
bed
I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
third--borough.
Exit
Third
by law: I'll not budge an inch
Falls asleep
Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting
Huntsman
Brach Merriman
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not
At the hedge-corner
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
Why
He cried upon it at the merest loss
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
Trust me
Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet
But sup them well and look unto them all:
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
I will
What's here? one dead
He breathes
O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
Grim death
Sirs
What think you
Believe me
It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
Then take him up and manage well the jest:
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
Procure me music ready when he wakes
And if he chance to speak
And with a low submissive reverence
Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
And when he says he is
This do and do it kindly
It will be pastime passing excellent
My lord
He is no less than what we say he is.
Take him up gently and to bed with him;
And each one to his office when he wakes.
Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds
Sirrah
Exit Servingman
Belike
Re-enter Servingman
How now! who is it?
An't please your honour
That offer service to your lordship.
Bid them come near.
Enter Players
Now
We thank your honour.
Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
So please your lordship to accept our duty.
With all my heart. This fellow I remember
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
I have forgot your name; but
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
Well
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
But I am doubtful of your modesties;
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior
For yet his honour never heard a play--
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him; for I tell you
Fear not
Go
Let them want nothing that my house affords.
Exit one with the Players
Sirrah
That done
And call him 'madam
Tell him from me
Unto their lords
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
May show her duty and make known her love?'
And then with kind embracements
To see her noble lord restored to health
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
To rain a shower of commanded tears
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
Exit a Servingman
I know the boy will well usurp the grace
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband
When they do homage to this simple peasant.
I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
May well abate the over-merry spleen
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord's house.
Enter aloft SLY
For God's sake
Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
you give me any conserves
beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
have no more doublets than backs
than legs
toes look through the over-leather.
Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
O
What
Sly
pedlar
bear-herd
Ask Marian Hacket
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
on the score for sheer ale
lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
bestraught: here's--
O
O
Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house
O noble lord
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
Look how thy servants do attend on thee
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays
And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags
Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
Adonis painted by a running brook
We'll show thee Io as she was a maid
Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood
Thou art a lord
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age.
And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face
And yet she is inferior to none.
Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
I do not sleep: I see
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
Upon my life
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
Well
And once again
Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
O
O
These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
Or when you waked
These fifteen years! by my fay
But did I never speak of all that time?
O
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber
And rail upon the hostess of the house;
And say you would present her at the leet
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
Ay
Why
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw.
Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!
Amen.
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
Enter the Page as a lady
How fares my noble lord?
Marry
Where is my wife?
Here
Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.
My husband and my lord
I am your wife in all obedience.
I know it well. What must I call her?
Madam.
Al'ce madam
'Madam
call ladies.
Madam wife
And slept above some fifteen year or more.
Ay
'Tis much. Servants
Madam
Thrice noble lord
To pardon me yet for a night or two
For your physicians have expressly charged
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
Ay
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh and the blood.
Enter a Messenger
Your honour's players
For so your doctors hold it very meet
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment
Marry
comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
No
What
It is a kind of history.
Well
and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.

ACT I
SCENE I. Padua. A public place.
Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
Tranio
To see fair Padua
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
With his good will and thy good company
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived
And therefore
Will I apply that treats of happiness
By virtue specially to be achieved.
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
Mi perdonato
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
Only
This virtue and this moral discipline
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
Music and poesy use to quicken you;
The mathematics and the metaphysics
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief
Gramercies
If
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: what company is this?
Master
Enter BAPTISTA
Gentlemen
That is
Before I have a husband for the elder:
If either of you both love Katharina
[Aside]  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
There
I pray you
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
Mates
I'faith
I wis it is not half way to her heart;
But if it were
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.
From all such devils
And me too
Hush
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
But in the other's silence do I see
Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
Peace
Well said
Gentlemen
What I have said
And let it not displease thee
A pretty peat! it is best
Put finger in the eye
Sister
Sir
My books and instruments shall be my company
Hark
Signior Baptista
Sorry am I that our good will effects
Bianca's grief.
Why will you mew her up
Gentlemen
Go in
Exit BIANCA
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music
I will be very kind
To mine own children in good bringing up:
And so farewell. Katharina
For I have more to commune with Bianca.
Exit
Why
knew not what to take and what to leave
Exit
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
good
so great
together
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
sweet Bianca
man to teach her that wherein she delights
wish him to her father.
So will I
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love
labour and effect one thing specially.
What's that
Marry
A husband! a devil.
I say
I say
her father be very rich
to be married to hell?
Tush
to endure her loud alarums
fellows in the world
I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
this condition
every morning.
Faith
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
friends
maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
How say you
I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
thoroughly woo her
house of her! Come on.
Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
I pray
That love should of a sudden take such hold?
O Tranio
But see
And now in plainness do confess to thee
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was
Counsel me
Assist me
Master
Affection is not rated from the heart:
If love have touch'd you
Gramercies
The rest will comfort
Master
O yes
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
Tranio
And with her breath she did perfume the air:
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
Nay
I pray
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his hands of her
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up
Ah
But art thou not advised
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
Ay
I have it
Master
Tell me thine first.
You will be schoolmaster
And undertake the teaching of the maid:
That's your device.
It is: may it be done?
Not possible; for who shall bear your part
Basta; content thee
We have not yet been seen in any house
For man or master; then it follows thus;
Thou shalt be master
I will some other be
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio
Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
When Biondello comes
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
So had you need.
In brief
For so your father charged me at our parting
I am content to be Lucentio
Tranio
And let me be a slave
Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
Here comes the rogue.
Enter BIONDELLO
Sirrah
Where have I been! Nay
Master
you stolen his? or both? pray
Sirrah
Your fellow Tranio here
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on him
You understand me?
I
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
The better for him: would I were so too!
So could I
But
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone
But in all places else your master Lucentio.
Tranio
thyself execute
thou ask me why
and weighty.
Exeunt
The presenters above speak
My lord
Yes
comes there any more of it?
My lord
'Tis a very excellent piece of work
would 'twere done!
They sit and mark
SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.
Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO
Verona
My best beloved and approved friend
Here
Knock
rebused your worship?
Villain
Knock you here
I should knock you here
Villain
And rap me well
My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
you first
Will it not be?
Faith
I'll try how you can sol
He wrings him by the ears
Help
Now
Enter HORTENSIO
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
Signior Hortensio
'Con tutto il cuore
'Alla nostra casa ben venuto
mio Petruchio.' Rise
this quarrel.
Nay
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service
him soundly
use his master so
well knock'd at first
A senseless villain! Good Hortensio
And could not get him for my heart to do it.
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
words plain
now with
Sirrah
Petruchio
Why
And tell me now
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
Such wind as scatters young men through the world
Where small experience grows. But in a few
Antonio
And I have thrust myself into this maze
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home
Petruchio
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend
Signior Hortensio
Few words suffice; and therefore
One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife
As Socrates' Xanthippe
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily
Nay
mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
a tooth in her head
as two and fifty horses: why
Petruchio
I can
With wealth enough and young and beauteous
Her only fault
And shrewd and froward
That
Hortensio
Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
For I will board her
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
Her father is Baptista Minola
Her name is Katharina Minola
I know her father
And he knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter
I pray you
O' my word
would think scolding would do little good upon him:
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
why
his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir
stand him but a little
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
You know him not
Tarry
He hath the jewel of my life in hold
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
Katharina the curst!
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music
That so I may
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected court her by herself.
Here's no knavery! See
Enter GREMIO
Master
Peace
Petruchio
A proper stripling and an amorous!
O
Hark you
All books of love
And see you read no other lectures to her:
You understand me: over and beside
Signior Baptista's liberality
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
Whate'er I read to her
As for my patron
Yea
Than you
O this learning
O this woodcock
Peace
Grumio
And you are well met
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
I promised to inquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man
Fit for her turn
And other books
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
Hath promised me to help me to another
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca
Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.
And that his bags shall prove.
Gremio
Listen to me
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met
So said
Hortensio
I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
If that be all
No
Born in Verona
My father dead
And I do hope good days and long to see.
O sir
But if you have a stomach
You shall have me assisting you in all.
But will you woo this wild-cat?
Will I live?
Will he woo her? ay
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
Loud 'larums
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue
As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
Tush
For he fears none.
Hortensio
This gentleman is happily arrived
I promised we would be contributors
And bear his charging of wooing
And so we will
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
Enter TRANIO brave
Gentlemen
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
Even he
Hark you
Perhaps
Not her that chides
I love no chiders
Well begun
Sir
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of
And if I be
No; if without more words you will get you hence.
Why
For me as for you?
But so is not she.
For what reason
For this reason
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
Softly
Baptista is a noble gentleman
And were his daughter fairer than she is
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one
What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
Sir
Hortensio
Sir
No
As is the other for beauteous modesty.
Sir
Yea
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
Sir
The younges t daughter whom you hearken for
Her father keeps from all access of suitors
Until the elder sister first be wed:
The younger then is free and not before.
If it be so
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest
For our access
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
Sir
And since you do profess to be a suitor
Sir
O excellent motion! Fellows
The motion's good indeed and be it so
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.
Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA
Good sister
That I disdain: but for these other gawds
Or what you will command me will I do
Of all thy suitors
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
Believe me
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other.
Minion
If you affect him
I'll plead for you myself
him.
O then
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Nay then you jest
You have but jested with me all this while:
I prithee
If that be jest
Strikes her
Enter BAPTISTA
Why
Bianca
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
For shame
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
Her silence flouts me
Flies after BIANCA
What
Exit BIANCA
What
She is your treasure
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
Exit
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
But who comes here?
Enter GREMIO
Good morrow
Good morrow
God save you
And you
Call'd Katharina
I have a daughter
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
You wrong me
I am a gentleman of Verona
Within your house
Of that report which I so oft have heard.
And
Cunning in music and the mathematics
Accept of him
His name is Licio
You're welcome
But for my daughter Katharina
I see you do not mean to part with her
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
Whence are you
Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
Saving your tale
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
O
I doubt it not
wooing. Neighbour
sure of it. To express the like kindness
any
that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
in Greek
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray
A thousand thanks
Welcome
To TRANIO
But
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
Pardon me
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
This liberty is all that I request
And free access and favour as the rest:
And
If you accept them
Lucentio is your name; of whence
Of Pisa
A mighty man of Pisa; by report
I know him well: you are very welcome
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla
Enter a Servant
Sirrah
To my daughters; and tell them both
Exit Servant
We will go walk a little in the orchard
Signior Baptista
You knew my father well
Then tell me
After my death the one half of my lands
And
Her widowhood
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us
Ay
Why
And where two raging fires meet together
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
Though little fire grows great with little wind
So I to her and so she yields to me;
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
Well mayst thou woo
But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
Ay
Re-enter HORTENSIO
How now
For fear
What
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
Iron may hold with her
Why
Why
I did but tell her she mistook her frets
When
with them:'
And
And there I stood amazed for a while
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms
Now
I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
O
Well
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
Signior Petruchio
I pray you do.
Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
I will attend her here
Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
Say that she frown
As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
Then I'll commend her volubility
If she do bid me pack
If she deny to wed
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
But here she comes; and now
Enter KATHARINA
Good morrow
Well have you heard
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
You lie
But Kate
Kate of Kate Hall
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town
Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
You were a moveable.
Why
A join'd-stool.
Thou hast hit it: come
Asses are made to bear
Women are made to bear
No such jade as you
Alas! good Kate
For
Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
Should be! should--buzz!
Well ta'en
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
Ay
Come
If I be waspish
My remedy is then
Ay
wear his sting? In his tail.
In his tongue.
Whose tongue?
Yours
What
That I'll try.
She strikes him
I swear I'll cuff you
So may you lose your arms:
If you strike me
And if no gentleman
A herald
What is your crest? a coxcomb?
A combless cock
No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.
Nay
It is my fashion
Why
There is
Then show it me.
Had I a glass
What
Well aim'd of such a young one.
Now
Yet you are wither'd.
'Tis with cares.
I care not.
Nay
I chafe you
No
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen
For thou are pleasant
Thou canst not frown
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
O
Go
Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
O
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
It is extempore
A witty mother! witless else her son.
Am I not wise?
Yes; keep you warm.
Marry
And therefore
That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
And
Now
For
For I am he am born to tame you Kate
Conformable as other household Kates.
Here comes your father: never make denial;
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
Re-enter BAPTISTA
Now
How but well
It were impossible I should speed amiss.
Why
Call you me daughter? now
You have show'd a tender fatherly regard
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack
Father
If she be curst
She is not hot
For patience she will prove a second Grissel
And to conclude
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
Hark
hang'd first.
Is this your speeding? nay
Be patient
If she and I be pleased
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain
I tell you
How much she loves me: O
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast
O
Give me thy hand
Provide the feast
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
God send you joy
Amen
Father
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
We will have rings and things and fine array;
And kiss me
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
Faith
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
'Twill bring you gain
The gain I seek is
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
But now
Now is the day we long have looked for:
I am your neighbour
And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness
Youngling
Graybeard
But thine doth fry.
Skipper
But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
Content you
'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Shall have my Bianca's love.
Say
First
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints
To house or housekeeping: then
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail
Myself am struck in years
And if I die to-morrow
That 'only' came well in. Sir
I am my father's heir and only son:
If I may have your daughter to my wife
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land

My land amounts not to so much in all:
That she shall have; besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles' road.

Be bride to you

Must get a father
And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing

Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?

Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain?
Then give me leave to read philosophy

I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times

You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
That will be never: tune your instrument.

But say
Why

near-legged before and with
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which
restrained to keep him from stumbling
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure
in studs
Who comes with him?
O
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other
and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster
very monster in apparel
footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
I am glad he's come
Why
Didst thou not say he comes?
Who? that Petruchio came?
Ay
No

Tedious it were to tell
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word

The morning wears
See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.

Good sooth
To me she's married
Could I repair what she will wear in me

Trembled and shook; for why
But after many ceremonies done
He had been aboard
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
This done
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
And after me
Such a mad marriage never was before:

Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself:
And
And for the love he beareth to your daughter
And she to him
No worse than I
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
For curious I cannot be with you
Sir
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him
And therefore
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
I thank you
We be affied and such assurance ta'en
As shall with either part's agreement stand?
Not in my house
Besides
And happily we might be interrupted.

And what of him?
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
And then?
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
command at all hours.
And what of all this?
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her
church; take the priest
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for

son
Call forth an officer.
Enter one with an Officer
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista
Carry me to the gaol!
Stay
Talk not
Take heed
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
is the right Vincentio.
Swear
Nay
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
Yes
Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous villain!
Re-enter BIONDELLO
O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him
[Kneeling]  Pardon
Lives my sweet son?
Exeunt BIONDELLO
Pardon
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?
Here's Lucentio
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine
Here's packing
Where is that damned villain Tranio
Why
Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did
Then pardon him
I'll slit the villain's nose
me to the gaol.
But do you hear
without asking my good will?
Fear not
I will in
Exit
And I
Exit
Look not pale
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest
Exit
Husband
First kiss me
What
What
No
Why
Nay
Is not this well? Come
Better once than never
Exeunt
SCENE II. Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.
Enter BAPTISTA
At last
And time it is
My fair Bianca
Brother Petruchio
My banquet is to close our stomachs up
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
Nothing but sit and sit
Padua affords this kindness
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
For both our sakes
Now
Then never trust me
You are very sensible
I mean
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
Roundly replied.
Mistress
Thus I conceive by him.
Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
My widow says
Very well mended. Kiss him for that
'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
I pray you
Your husband
And now you know my meaning
Right
And I am mean indeed
To her
To her
A hundred marks
That's my office.
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee
Drinks to HORTENSIO
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
Believe me
Head
Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
Ay
Ay
Nay
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.
Exeunt BIANCA
She hath prevented me. Here
This bird you aim'd at
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
O
A good swift simile
'Tis well
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
O ho
I thank thee for that gird
Confess
A' has a little gall'd me
And
Now
Well
Let's each one send unto his wife;
And he whose wife is most obedient
To come at first when he doth send for her
Content. What is the wager?
Twenty crowns.
Twenty crowns!
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound
A hundred then.
Content.
A match! 'tis done.
Who shall begin?
That will I.
Go
I go.
Exit
Son
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
Re-enter BIONDELLO
How now! what news?
Sir
That she is busy and she cannot come.
How! she is busy and she cannot come!
Is that an answer?
Ay
Pray God
I hope better.
Sirrah Biondello
To come to me forthwith.
Exit BIONDELLO
O
Nay
I am afraid
Re-enter BIONDELLO
Now
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
She will not come: she bids you come to her.
Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile
Sirrah Grumio
Say
Exit GRUMIO
I know her answer.
What?
She will not.
The fouler fortune mine
Now
Re-enter KATARINA
What is your will
Where is your sister
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
Away
Exit KATHARINA
Here is a wonder
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
Marry
And
Now
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another daughter
Nay
And show more sign of her obedience
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
Re-enter KATHARINA
Katharina
Off with that bauble
Lord
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
I would your duty were as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty
The more fool you
Katharina
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
Come
Come on
She shall not.
I say she shall: and first begin with her.
Fie
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled
And while it is so
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord
To painful labour both by sea and land
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she is froward
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
I am ashamed that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
Or seek for rule
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come
My mind hath been as big as one of yours
But now I see our lances are but straws
Then vail your stomachs
In token of which duty
Why
Well
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
Come
We three are married
To LUCENTIO
'Twas I won the wager
And
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA
Now
'Tis a wonder
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise
of thunder and lightning heard.
Enter a Master and a Boatswain
Boatswain!
Here
Good
Exit
Enter Mariners
Heigh
yare
master's whistle. Blow
Enter ALONSO
Good boatswain
Play the men.
I pray now
Where is the master
Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
cabins: you do assist the storm.
Nay
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
Good
None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour
of our way
Exit
I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable
born to be hanged
Exeunt
Re-enter Boatswain
Down with the topmast! yare! lower
her to try with main-course.
A cry within
A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
the weather or our office.
Re-enter SEBASTIAN
Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
A pox o' your throat
Work you then.
Hang
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.
Lay her a-hold
sea again; lay her off.
Enter Mariners wet
All lost! to prayers
What
The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them
I'm out of patience.
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
The washing of ten tides!
He'll be hang'd yet
And gape at widest to glut him.
A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--  'We split
Let's all sink with the king.
Let's take leave of him.
Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA
If by your art
Put the wild waters in this roar
The sky
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel
Against my very heart. Poor souls
Had I been any god of power
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
The fraughting souls within her.
Be collected:
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
There's no harm done.
O
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee
Art ignorant of what thou art
Of whence I am
Than Prospero
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
'Tis time
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand
Lays down his mantle
Lie there
The direful spectacle of the wreck
The very virtue of compassion in thee
So safely ordered that there is no soul--
No
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Which thou heard'st cry
For thou must now know farther.
You have often
Begun to tell me what I am
And left me to a bootless inquisition
The hour's now come;
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell?
I do not think thou canst
Out three years old.
Certainly
By what? by any other house or person?
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance.
'Tis far off
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me?
Thou hadst
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time?
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here
But that I do not.
Twelve year since
A prince of power.
Sir
Thy mother was a piece of virtue
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
And princess no worse issued.
O the heavens!
What foul play had we
Or blessed was't we did?
Both
By foul play
O
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to
My brother and thy uncle
I pray thee
Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
Of all the world I loved and to him put
The manage of my state; as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke
In dignity
Without a parallel; those being all my study
And to my state grew stranger
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
Dost thou attend me?
Sir
Being once perfected how to grant suits
To trash for over-topping
The creatures that were mine
Of officer and office
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk
O
I pray thee
I
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
With that which
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit
Who having into truth
He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
And executing the outward face of royalty
Dost thou hear?
Your tale
To have no screen between this part he play'd
And him he play'd it for
Absolute Milan. Me
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
To give him annual tribute
The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas
To most ignoble stooping.
O the heavens!
Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
If this might be a brother.
I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother:
Good wombs have borne bad sons.
Now the condition.
The King of Naples
To me inveterate
Which was
Of homage and I know not how much tribute
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother: whereon
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
The gates of Milan
Me and thy crying self.
Alack
I
That wrings mine eyes to't.
Hear a little further
And then I'll bring thee to the present business
Which now's upon's; without the which this story
Were most impertinent.
Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us?
Well demanded
My tale provokes that question. Dear
A mark so bloody on the business
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
In few
A rotten carcass of a boat
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us
To the winds whose pity
Alack
Was I then to you!
O
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
Infused with a fortitude from heaven
An undergoing stomach
Against what should ensue.
How came we ashore?
By Providence divine.
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan
Master of this design
Rich garments
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom.
Would I might
But ever see that man!
Now I arise:
Resumes his mantle
Sit still
Here in this island we arrived; and here
Have I
Than other princesses can that have more time
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
Heavens thank you for't! And now
For raising this sea-storm?
Know thus far forth.
By accident most strange
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star
If now I court not but omit
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness
MIRANDA sleeps
Come away
Approach
Enter ARIEL
All hail
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly
On the curl'd clouds
Ariel and all his quality.
Hast thou
To every article.
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak
O' the dreadful thunder-claps
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
My brave spirit!
Who was so firm
Would not infect his reason?
Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel
Was the first man that leap'd; cried
And all the devils are here.'
Why that's my spirit!
But was not this nigh shore?
Close by
But are they
Not a hair perish'd;
On their sustaining garments not a blemish
The king's son have I landed by himself;
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting
Of the king's ship
The mariners say how thou hast disposed
And all the rest o' the fleet.
Safely in harbour
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
Who
Which I dispersed
And are upon the Mediterranean flote
And his great person perish.
Ariel
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
What is the time o' the day?
Past the mid season.
At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
Must by us both be spent most preciously.
Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains
How now? moody?
What is't thou canst demand?
My liberty.
Before the time be out? no more!
I prithee
Told thee no lies
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
To bate me a full year.
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?
No.
Thou dost
Of the salt deep
When it is baked with frost.
I do not
Thou liest
The foul witch Sycorax
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
No
Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
Sir
O
Once in a month recount what thou hast been
To enter human hearing
They would not take her life. Is not this true?
Ay
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
And here was left by the sailors. Thou
And
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands
And in her most unmitigable rage
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
A dozen years; within which space she died
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
Save for the son that she did litter here
A human shape.
Yes
Dull thing
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
To lay upon the damn'd
Could not again undo: it was mine art
The pine and let thee out.
I thank thee
If thou more murmur'st
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
Pardon
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spiriting gently.
Do so
I will discharge thee.
That's my noble master!
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
To no sight but thine and mine
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
And hither come in't: go
Exit ARIEL
Awake
The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me.
Shake it off. Come on;
We'll visit Caliban my slave
Yields us kind answer.
'Tis a villain
But
That profit us. What
Thou earth
[Within]  There's wood enough within.
Come forth
Come
Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel
My lord it shall be done.
Exit
Thou poisonous slave
Upon thy wicked dam
Enter CALIBAN
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!
For this
Shall
As thick as honeycomb
Than bees that made 'em.
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine
Water with berries in't
To name the bigger light
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
Of Sycorax
For I am all the subjects that you have
In this hard rock
The rest o' the island.
Thou most lying slave
In mine own cell
The honour of my child.
O ho
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.
Abhorred slave
One thing or other: when thou didst not
A thing most brutish
With words that made them known. But thy vile race
good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this rock
You taught me language; and my profit on't
Is
For learning me your language!
Hag-seed
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
What I command
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
No
Aside
I must obey: his art is of such power
So
Exit CALIBAN
Re-enter ARIEL
ARIEL'S song.
Come unto these yellow sands
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
The wild waves whist
And
Hark
Burthen [dispersedly
The watch-dogs bark!
Burthen Bow-wow
Hark
The strain of strutting chanticleer
Cry
Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
It sounds no more: and sure
Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it
No
ARIEL sings
Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made;
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
Nothing of him that doth fade
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
Burthen Ding-dong
Hark! now I hear them
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
This is no mortal business
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond.
What is't? a spirit?
Lord
No
As we have
Was in the wreck; and
With grief that's beauty's canker
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
And strays about to find 'em.
I might call him
A thing divine
I ever saw so noble.
[Aside] It goes on
Within two days for this.
Most sure
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
May know if you remain upon this island;
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here: my prime request
If you be maid or no?
No wonder
But certainly a maid.
My language! heavens!
I am the best of them that speak this speech
How? the best?
What wert thou
A single thing
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples
The king my father wreck'd.
Alack
Yes
And his brave son being twain.
"[Aside]	The Duke of Milan"
And his more braver daughter could control thee
They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel
To FERDINAND
A word
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
Why speaks my father so ungently? This
Is the third man that e'er I saw
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
To be inclined my way!
O
The queen of Naples.
Soft
Aside
They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
I must uneasy make
Make the prize light.
To FERDINAND
One word more; I charge thee
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
Upon this island as a spy
From me
No
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
If the ill spirit have so fair a house
Follow me.
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
The fresh-brook muscles
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
No;
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power.
Draws
O dear father
He's gentle and not fearful.
What? I say
Who makest a show but darest not strike
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward
And make thy weapon drop.
Beseech you
Hence! hang not on my garments.
Sir
I'll be his surety.
Silence! one word more
Shall make me chide thee
An advocate for an imposter! hush!
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he
To the most of men this is a Caliban
And they to him are angels.
My affections
Are then most humble; I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man.
Come on; obey:
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them.
So they are;
My spirits
My father's loss
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
Let liberty make use of; space enough
Have I in such a prison.
[Aside]                It works.
To FERDINAND
Come on.
Thou hast done well
To FERDINAND
Follow me.
To ARIEL
Hark what thou else shalt do me.
Be of comfort;
My father's of a better nature
Which now came from him.
Thou shalt be free
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
All points of my command.
To the syllable.
Come
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. Another part of the island.
Enter ALONSO
Beseech you
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common; every day some sailor's wife
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle
Can speak like us: then wisely
Our sorrow with our comfort.
Prithee
He receives comfort like cold porridge.
The visitor will not give him o'er so.
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
by and by it will strike.
Sir
One: tell.
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd
A dollar.
Dolour comes to him
have spoken truer than you purposed.
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
Therefore
Fie
I prithee
Well
He will be talking.
Which
wager
The old cock.
The cockerel.
Done. The wager?
A laughter.
A match!
Though this island seem to be desert
Ha
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
Yet
Yet
He could not miss't.
It must needs be of subtle
temperance.
Temperance was a delicate wench.
Ay
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
Here is everything advantageous to life.
True; save means to live.
Of that there's none
How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
The ground indeed is tawny.
With an eye of green in't.
He misses not much.
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
But the rarity of it is
beyond credit
As many vouched rarities are.
That our garments
the sea
glosses
salt water.
If but one of his pockets could speak
say he lies?
Ay
Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in Afric
the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
'Twas a sweet marriage
Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen.
Not since widow Dido's time.
Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
widow Dido!
What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord
'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
she was of Carthage
This Tunis
Carthage?
I assure you
His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
raised the wall and houses too.
What impossible matter will he make easy next?
I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple.
And
forth more islands.
Ay.
Why
Sir
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter
And the rarest that e'er came there.
Bate
O
Is not
wore it? I mean
That sort was well fished for.
When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
Married my daughter there! for
I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
Of Naples and of Milan
Hath made his meal on thee?
Sir
I saw him beat the surges under him
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
'Bove the contentious waves he kept
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
To the shore
He came alive to land.
No
Sir
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye
Prithee
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
By all of us
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience
Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
son
More widows in them of this business' making
Than we bring men to comfort them:
The fault's your own.
So is the dear'st o' the loss.
My lord Sebastian
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore
Very well.
And most chirurgeonly.
It is foul weather in us all
Foul weather?
Very foul.
Had I plantation of this isle
He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
Or docks
And were the king on't
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
Letters should not be known; riches
No use of metal
No occupation; all men idle
And women too
No sovereignty;--
Yet he would be king on't.
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning.
All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour: treason
No marrying 'mong his subjects?
None
I would with such perfection govern
God save his majesty!
Long live Gonzalo!
And
Prithee
I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen
they always use to laugh at nothing.
'Twas you we laughed at.
Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you: so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still.
What a blow was there given!
An it had not fallen flat-long.
You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
the moon out of her sphere
in it five weeks without changing.
Enter ARIEL
We would so
Nay
No
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep
Go sleep
All sleep except ALONSO
What
Would
They are inclined to do so.
Please you
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth
We two
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL
What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
It is the quality o' the climate.
Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
Myself disposed to sleep.
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
They fell together all
They dropp'd
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head.
What
Do you not hear me speak?
I do; and surely
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
This is a strange repose
With eyes wide open; standing
Noble Sebastian
Whiles thou art waking.
Thou dost snore distinctly;
There's meaning in thy snores.
I am more serious than my custom: you
Must be so too
Trebles thee o'er.
Well
I'll teach you how to flow.
Do so: to ebb
Hereditary sloth instructs me.
O
Whiles thus you mock it! how
By their own fear or sloth.
Prithee
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
A matter from thee
Which throes thee much to yield.
Thus
Although this lord of weak remembrance
When he is earth'd
For he's a spirit of persuasion
Professes to persuade
And he that sleeps here swims.
I have no hope
That he's undrown'd.
O
What great hope have you! no hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
That Ferdinand is drown'd?
He's gone.
Then
Claribel.
She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
Can have no note
The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
We all were sea-swallow'd
Whereof what's past is prologue
In yours and my discharge.
What stuff is this! how say you?
'Tis true
So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
There is some space.
A space whose every cubit
Seems to cry out
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis
That now hath seized them; why
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat. O
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
For your advancement! Do you understand me?
Methinks I do.
And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune?
I remember
You did supplant your brother Prospero.
True:
And look how well my garments sit upon me;
Much feater than before: my brother's servants
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
But
Ay
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother
Whom I
This ancient morsel
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest
They'll tell the clock to any business that
We say befits the hour.
Thy case
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
And I the king shall love thee.
Draw together;
And when I rear my hand
O
They talk apart
Re-enter ARIEL
My master through his art foresees the danger
That you
For else his project dies--to keep them living.
Sings in GONZALO's ear
While you here do snoring lie
His time doth take.
If of life you keep a care
Awake
Then let us both be sudden.
Now
Preserve the king.
They wake
Why
Wherefore this ghastly looking?
What's the matter?
Whiles we stood here securing your repose
Like bulls
It struck mine ear most terribly.
I heard nothing.
O
Of a whole herd of lions.
Heard you this
Upon mine honour
I shaked you
Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
For my poor son.
Heavens keep him from these beasts!
For he is
Lead away.
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
So
Exeunt
SCENE II. Another part of the island.
Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard
All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch
Out of my way
For every trifle are they set upon me;
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
And after bite me
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.
Enter TRINCULO
Lo
Here comes a spirit of his
For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
Perchance he will not mind me.
Here's neither bush nor shrub
any weather at all
I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
cloud
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
should thunder as it did before
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now
of silver: there would this monster make a
man; any strange beast there makes a man:
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish
thunderbolt.
Thunder
Alas
creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past.
Enter STEPHANO
I shall no more to sea
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
funeral: well
Drinks
Sings
The master
Loved Mall
For she had a tongue with a tang
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch
Then to sea
This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
Drinks
Do not torment me: Oh!
What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
four legs; for it hath been said
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
and it shall be said so again while Stephano
breathes at's nostrils.
The spirit torments me; Oh!
This is some monster of the isle with four legs
hath got
should he learn our language? I will give him some
relief
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
Do not torment me
He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame
not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
hath him
Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.
Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
which will give language to you
mouth; this will shake your shaking
open your chaps again.
I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!
Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
His forward voice now is to speak well of his
friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
recover him
will pour some in thy other mouth.
Stephano!
Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy

long spoon.
Stephano! If thou beest Stephano
speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
good friend Trinculo.
If thou beest Trinculo
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs
camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
he vent Trinculos?
I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
art thou not drowned
not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
the storm. And art thou living
Stephano
Prithee
[Aside]  These be fine things
not sprites.
That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
I will kneel to him.
How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
heaved o'erboard
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
cast ashore.
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
for the liquor is not earthly.
Here; swear then how thou escapedst.
Swum ashore. man

O Stephano. hast any more of this?
The whole butt

how does thine ague?
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
Out o' the moon
the moon when time was.
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
Come

By this good light
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
drawn
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee
By this light
monster! when 's god's asleep
I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.
Come on then; down
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
heart to beat him
Come
But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!
I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
I'll bear him no more sticks
A most ridiculous monster
Poor drunkard!
I prithee
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
I prithee now

and by again.
[Sings drunkenly]
Farewell master; farewell
A howling monster: a drunken monster!
No more dams I'll make for fish
Nor fetch in firing
At requiring;
Nor scrape trencher
'Ban
Has a new master: get a new man.

ACT III
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell.
Enter FERDINAND
There be some sports are painful
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
And makes my labours pleasures: O
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up
Weeps when she sees me work
Had never like executor. I forget:
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance
Alas
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
Pray
Is hard at study; pray now
He's safe for these three hours.
O most dear mistress
What I must strive to do.
If you'll sit down
I'll carry it to the pile.
No
I had rather crack my sinews
It would become me
As well as it does you: and I should do it
With much more ease; for my good will is to it
Poor worm
This visitation shows it.
You look wearily.
No
When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
What is your name?
Miranda.--O my father
Admired Miranda!
Indeed the top of admiration! worth
What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
I have eyed with best regard and many a time
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
Have I liked several women; never any
With so fun soul
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
And put it to the foil: but you
Of every creature's best!
I do not know
One of my sex; no woman's face remember
More that I may call men than you
Any companion in the world but you
Something too wildly and my father's precepts
I therein do forget.
I am in my condition
A prince
I would
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
The very instant that I saw you
My heart fly to your service; there resides
Am I this patient log--man.
Do you love me?
O heaven
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true! if hollowly
What best is boded me to mischief! I
Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
Do love
I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of.
Fair encounter
Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
On that which breeds between 'em!
Wherefore weep you?
At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
What I desire to give
What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
And all the more it seeks to hide itself
And prompt me
I am your wife
If not
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant
My mistress
And I thus humble ever.
My husband
Ay
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
And mine
Till half an hour hence.
A thousand thousand!
Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally
So glad of this as they I cannot be
At nothing can be more. I'll to my book
Much business appertaining.

SCENE II. Another part of the island.
Enter CALIBAN
Tell not me; when the butt is out

board 'em. Servant-monster
Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They

of them; if th' other two be brained like us

Where should they be set else? he were a brave
monster indeed
My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
for my part
could recover the shore
and on. By this light
Your lieutenant
We'll not run
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
nothing neither.
Moon-calf
good moon-calf.
How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
Thou liest
justle a constable. Why
sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie
Lo
'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
Lo
Trinculo
prove a mutineer
my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
Marry
Enter ARIEL
As I told thee before
sorcerer
Thou liest.
Thou liest
valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.
Trinculo
this hand
Why
Mum
I say
From me he got it. if thy greatness will
Revenge it on him
That's most certain.
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party?
Yea
Thou liest; thou canst not.
What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
I do beseech thy greatness
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
Where the quick freshes are.
Trinculo
interrupt the monster one word further
and make a stock-fish of thee.
Why
off.
Didst thou not say he lied?
Thou liest.
Do I so? take thou that.
Beats TRINCULO
As you like this
I did not give the lie. Out o' your
wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
your monster
Ha
Now
off.
Beat him enough: after a little time
I'll beat him too.
Stand farther. Come
Why
Batter his skull
First to possess his books; for without them
He's but a sot
One spirit to command: they all do hate him
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
He has brave utensils
Which when he has a house
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter; he himself
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
As great'st does least.
Is it so brave a lass?
Ay
And bring thee forth brave brood.
Monster
will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
like the plot
Excellent.
Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but
Within this half hour will he be asleep:
Wilt thou destroy him then?
Ay
This will I tell my master.
Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
You taught me but while-ere?
At thy request
reason. Come on
Sings
Flout 'em and scout 'em
And scout 'em and flout 'em
Thought is free.
That's not the tune.
Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe
What is this same?
This is the tune of our catch
of Nobody.
If thou beest a man
if thou beest a devil
O
He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
Art thou afeard?
No
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears
That
Ready to drop upon me that
This will prove a brave kingdom to me
have my music for nothing.
When Prospero is destroyed.
That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
The sound is going away; let's follow it
after do our work.

Wilt come? I'll follow

SCENE III. Another part of the island.
Enter ALONSO
By'r lakin
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience
Old lord
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
Whom thus we stray to find
Our frustrate search on land. Well
[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so
out of hope.
Do not
That you resolved to effect.
[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage
Will we take throughly.

For

Solemn and strange music
What harmony is this? My good friends
Marvellous sweet music!

Give us kind keepers
A living drollery. Now I will believe
That there are unicorns
There is one tree
At this hour reigning there.
I'll believe both;
And what does else want credit

If in Naples
I should report this now
If I should say
For

Our human generation you shall find
Many

Are worse than devils.
I cannot too much muse
Such shapes
Of excellent dumb discourse.
"[Aside]	Praise in departing."
They vanish'd strangely.
No matter
They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
Will't please you taste of what is here?
Not I.
Faith
Dew-lapp'd like bulls
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
Good warrant of.
I will stand to and feed
The best is past. Brother
Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL
You are three men of sin
And what is in't
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
Their proper selves.
ALONSO
You fools! I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate: the elements
Wound the loud winds
Kill the still-closing waters
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt
And will not be uplifted. But remember--
For that's my business to you--that you three
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
Exposed unto the sea
The powers
Incensed the seas and shores
Lingering perdition
Can be at once
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
Which here
Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
And a clear life ensuing.
He vanishes in thunder; then
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Perform'd
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
In what thou hadst to say: so
And observation strange
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
And these mine enemies are all knit up
In their distractions; they now are in my power;
And in these fits I leave them
Young Ferdinand
Exit above
I' the name of something holy
In this strange stare?
O
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
The winds did sing it to me
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded
I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
And with him there lie mudded.
Exit
But one fiend at a time
I'll be thy second.
Exeunt SEBASTIAN
All three of them are desperate: their great guilt
That are of suppler joints
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to.

ACT IV
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
Enter PROSPERO
If I have too austerely punish'd you
Have given you here a third of mine own life
I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love and thou
Hast strangely stood the test here
And make it halt behind her.
I do believe it
Against an oracle.
Then
Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be minister'd
To make this contract grow: but barren hate
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed
As I hope
For quiet days
Our worser genius can
Mine honour into lust
The edge of that day's celebration
When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd
Fairly spoke.
Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
What
Enter ARIEL
What would my potent master? here I am.
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Did worthily perform; and I must use you
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble
Incite them to quick motion; for I must
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise
Presently?
Ay
Before you can say 'come' and 'go
And breathe twice and cry 'so
Each one
Do you love me
Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call.
Well
Exit
Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious
I warrant you sir;
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardour of my liver.
Well.
Now come
No tongue! all eyes! be silent.
Soft music

Of wheat
Thy turfy mountains
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims
And thy sea-marge

Hail
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
Diffusest honey-drops
My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down
Summon'd me hither
A contract of true love to celebrate;
And some donation freely to estate
On the blest lovers.
Tell me
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got
I have forsworn.
Of her society
Be not afraid: I met her deity
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid
Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;
Mars's hot minion is returned again;
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows
And be a boy right out.
High'st queen of state
Enter JUNO
How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
To bless this twain
And honour'd in their issue.
They sing:
Honour
Juno sings her blessings upon you.
Earth's increase
Spring come to you at the farthest
In the very end of harvest!
Scarcity and want shall shun you;
Ceres' blessing so is on you.
This is a most majestic vision
Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
To think these spirits?
Spirits
I have from their confines call'd to enact
My present fancies.
Let me live here ever;
So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
Makes this place Paradise.
Juno and Ceres whisper
Sweet
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
There's something else to do: hush
You nymphs
Answer your summons; Juno does command:
Come
A contract of true love; be not too late.
Enter certain Nymphs
You sunburnt sicklemen
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
In country footing.
Enter certain Reapers
[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Against my life: the minute of their plot
Is almost come.
To the Spirits
Well done! avoid; no more!
This is strange: your father's in some passion
That works him strongly.
Never till this day
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
You do look
Our revels now are ended. These our actors
Are melted into air
And
And
As dreams are made on
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir
Bear with my weakness; my
Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
If you be pleased
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk
We wish your peace.
Exeunt
Come with a thought I thank thee
Enter ARIEL
Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
Spirit
Ay
Lest I might anger thee.
Say again
I told you
So fun of valour that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
At which
their ears
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
Tooth'd briers
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell
O'erstunk their feet.
This was well done
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
The trumpery in my house
I go

A devil
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains
And as with age his body uglier grows

PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN
Pray you
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
Monster
a harmless fairy
played the Jack with us.
Monster
which my nose is in great indignation.
So is mine. Do you hear
a displeasure against you
Thou wert but a lost monster.
Good my lord
Be patient
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
All's hush'd as midnight yet.
Ay
There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that
That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
harmless fairy
I will fetch off my bottle
for my labour.
Prithee
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever
Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
what a wardrobe here is for thee!
Let it alone
O
O king Stephano!
Put off that gown
that gown.
Thy grace shall have it.
The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
And do the murder first: if he awake
Be you quiet
the line: now
hair and prove a bald jerkin.
Do
I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
pass of pate; there's another garment for't.
Monster
away with the rest.
I will have none on't: we shall lose our time
With foreheads villanous low.
Monster
away where my hogshead of wine is
out of my kingdom: go to
And this.

Hey
Silver I there it goes
Fury
CALIBAN
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions
With aged cramps
Than pard or cat o' mountain.

Shortly shall all my labours end
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little

ACT V
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes
Now does my project gather to a head:
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
On the sixth hour; at which time
I did say so
Confined together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge
They cannot budge till your release. The king
And the remainder mourning over them
Him that you term'd
His tears run down his beard
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
That if you now beheld them
Would become tender.
Dost thou think so
Mine would
And mine shall.
Hast thou
Of their afflictions
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick
Do I take part: the rarer action is
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent
Not a frown further. Go release them
My charms I'll break
I'll fetch them
Exit
Ye elves of hills
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
Is to make midnight mushrooms
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid
The noontide sun
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
The pine and cedar: graves at my command
Have waked their sleepers
By my so potent art. But this rough magic
I here abjure
Some heavenly music
This airy charm is for
I'll drown my book.
Solemn music
Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO
A solemn air and the best comforter
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
Holy Gonzalo
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo
To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
Didst thou
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
Thou art pinch'd fort now
Begins to swell
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
That yet looks on me
I will discase me
As I was sometime Milan: quickly
Thou shalt ere long be free.
ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
In a cowslip's bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat's back I do fly
After summer merrily.
Merrily
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
Why
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so
To the king's ship
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
Being awake
I drink the air before me
Or ere your pulse twice beat.
Exit
All torment
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
Out of this fearful country!
Behold
For more assurance that a living prince
Does now speak to thee
And to thee and thy company I bid
A hearty welcome.
Whether thou best he or no
Beats as of flesh and blood; and
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
Be living and be here?
First
Be measured or confined.
Whether this be
Or be not
You do yet taste
Some subtilties o' the isle
Believe things certain. Welcome
Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
But you
And justify you traitors: at this time
I will tell no tales.
[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
No.
For you
Would even infect my mouth
Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
My dukedom of thee
If thou be'st Prospero
How thou hast met us here
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
My dear son Ferdinand.
I am woe for't
Irreparable is the loss
Says it is past her cure.
I rather think
You have not sought her help
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
And rest myself content.
You the like loss!
As great to me as late; and
To make the dear loss
Than you may call to comfort you
Have lost my daughter.
A daughter?
O heavens
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
At this encounter do so much admire
That they devour their reason and scarce think
Their eyes do offices of truth
Are natural breath: but
Been justled from your senses
That I am Prospero and that very duke
Which was thrust forth of Milan
Upon this shore
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
And subjects none abroad: pray you
My dukedom since you have given me again
At least bring forth a wonder
As much as me my dukedom.
Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess
Sweet lord
No
Yes
If this prove
A vision of the Island
Shall I twice lose.
A most high miracle!
Though the seas threaten
I have cursed them without cause.
Kneels
Now all the blessings
Of a glad father compass thee about!
Arise
O
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world
'Tis new to thee.
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us
Sir
But by immortal Providence she's mine:
I chose her when I could not ask my father
For his advice
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan
Received a second life; and second father
This lady makes him to me.
I am hers:
But
Must ask my child forgiveness!
There
Let us not burthen our remembrance with
A heaviness that's gone.
I have inly wept
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
Which brought us hither.
I say
Was Milan thrust from Milan
Should become kings of Naples? O
Beyond a common joy
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis
Where he himself was lost
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own.
[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy!
Be it so! Amen!
Re-enter ARIEL
O
I prophesied
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
The best news is
Our king and company; the next
Which
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
We first put out to sea.
[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir
Have I done since I went.
[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
These are not natural events; they strengthen
From strange to stranger. Say
If I did think
Where but even now with strange and several noises
Of roaring
Where we
Our royal
Capering to eye her: on a trice
And were brought moping hither.
[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?
[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of: some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge.
Sir
The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
Which shall be shortly
These happen'd accidents; till when
And think of each thing well.
Aside to ARIEL
Come hither
Set Caliban and his companions free;
Untie the spell.
Exit ARIEL
How fares my gracious sir?
There are yet missing of your company
Some few odd lads that you remember not.
Re-enter ARIEL
Every man shift for all the rest
let no man take care for himself; for all is
but fortune. Coragio
If these be true spies which I wear in my head
O Setebos
How fine my master is! I am afraid
He will chastise me.
Ha
What things are these
Will money buy 'em?
Very like; one of them
Is a plain fish
Mark but the badges of these men
That could control the moon
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
To take my life. Two of these fellows you
Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
Acknowledge mine.
I shall be pinch'd to death.
Is not this Stephano
He is drunk now: where had he wine?
And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
How camest thou in this pickle?
I have been in such a pickle since I
saw you last that
my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
Why
O
You'ld be king o' the isle
I should have been a sore one then.
This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
Pointing to Caliban
He is as disproportion'd in his manners
As in his shape. Go
Take with you your companions; as you look
To have my pardon
Ay
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
Was I
And worship this dull fool!
Go to; away!
Hence
Or stole it
Exeunt CALIBAN
Sir
To my poor cell
For this one night; which
With such discourse as
Go quick away; the story of my life
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
And thence retire me to my Milan
Every third thought shall be my grave.
I long
To hear the story of your life
Take the ear strangely.
I'll deliver all;
And promise you calm seas
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
Your royal fleet far off.
Aside to ARIEL

EPILOGUE
SPOKEN BY PROSPERO
Now my charms are all o'erthrown
And pardon'd the deceiver
In this bare island by your spell;
But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands:
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill
Spirits to enforce
Mercy itself and frees all faults.
As you from crimes would pardon'd be
ACT I
SCENE I. Athens. A hall in Timon's house.
Enter Poet
Good day
I am glad you're well.
I have not seen you long: how goes the world?
It wears
Ay
But what particular rarity? what strange
Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
O
Nay
A most incomparable man
He passes.
"Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--"
O
"Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but"
[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have
praised the vile
Which aptly sings the good.'
'Tis a good form.
Looking at the jewel
And rich: here is a water
You are rapt
To the great lord.
A thing slipp'd idly from me.
Our poesy is as a gum
From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
Provokes itself and like the current flies
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
A picture
Upon the heels of my presentment
Let's see your piece.
'Tis a good piece.
So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
Indifferent.
Admirable: how this grace
Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
One might interpret.
It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Here is a touch; is't good?
I will say of it
Lives in these touches
Enter certain Senators
How this lord is follow'd!
The senators of Athens: happy man!
Look
You see this confluence
of visitors.
I have
With amplest entertainment: my free drift
Halts not particularly
In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
Infects one comma in the course I hold;
But flies an eagle flight
How shall I understand you?
I will unbolt to you.
You see how all conditions
Of grave and austere quality
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
All sorts of hearts; yea
To Apemantus
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
The knee before him
Most rich in Timon's nod.
I saw them speak together.
Sir
Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
Is rank'd with all deserts
To propagate their states: amongst them all
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Translates his rivals.
'Tis conceived to scope.
This throne
To climb his happiness
In our condition.
Nay
All those which were his fellows but of late
Follow his strides
Drink the free air.
Ay
When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Spurns down her late beloved
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
Even on their knees and hands
'Tis common:
A thousand moral paintings I can show
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
The foot above the head.
Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON
Imprison'd is he
Ay
Your honourable letter he desires
To those have shut him up; which failing
Noble Ventidius! Well;
I am not of that feather to shake off
My friend when he must need me. I do know him
A gentleman that well deserves a help:
Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt
Your lordship ever binds him.
Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
And being enfranchised
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up
All happiness to your honour!
Exit
Enter an old Athenian
Lord Timon
Freely
Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.
I have so: what of him?
Most noble Timon
Attends he here
Here
This fellow here
That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
And my estate deserves an heir more raised
Than one which holds a trencher.
Well; what further?
One only daughter have I
The maid is fair
In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Attempts her love: I prithee
Myself have spoke in vain.
The man is honest.
Therefore he will be
His honesty rewards him in itself;
It must not bear my daughter.
Does she love him?
She is young and apt:
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
What levity's in youth.
[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?
Ay
If in her marriage my consent be missing
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world
How shall she be endow'd
Three talents on the present; in future
This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
To build his fortune I will strain a little
What you bestow
Most noble lord
My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
The state or fortune fall into my keeping
Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian
Vouchsafe my labour
I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
Go not away. What have you there
A piece of painting
Your lordship to accept.
Painting is welcome.
The painting is almost the natural man;
or since dishonour traffics with man's nature
Even such as they give out. I like your work;
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
Till you hear further from me.
The gods preserve ye!
Well fare you
We must needs dine together. Sir
Hath suffer'd under praise.
What
A more satiety of commendations.
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd
My lord
As those which sell would give: but you well know
Are prized by their masters: believe't
Well mock'd.
No
Look
Enter APEMANTUS
Jeweller: We'll bear
He'll spare none.
Good morrow to thee
Till I be gentle
When thou art Timon's dog
Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
Are they not Athenians?
Yes.
Then I repent not.
Jeweller: You know me
Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
Thou art proud
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
Whither art going?
To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
That's a deed thou'lt die for.
Right
How likest thou this picture
The best
Wrought he not well that painted it?
He wrought better that made the painter; and yet
he's but a filthy piece of work.
You're a dog.
Thy mother's of my generation: what's she
Wilt dine with me
No; I eat not lords.
An thou shouldst
O
That's a lascivious apprehension.
So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
How dost thou like this jewel
Not so well as plain-dealing
man a doit.
What dost thou think 'tis worth?
Not worth my thinking. How now
How now
Thou liest.
Art not one?
Yes.
Then I lie not.
Art not a poet?
Yes.
Then thou liest: look in thy last work
hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
That's not feigned; he is so.
Yes
labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
the flatterer. Heavens
What wouldst do then
E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.
What
Ay.
Wherefore?
That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
Art not thou a merchant?
Ay
Traffic confound thee
If traffic do it
Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!
Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger
What trumpet's that?
'Tis Alcibiades
Pray
Exeunt some Attendants
You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done
Enter ALCIBIADES
Most welcome
So
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
That there should be small love 'mongst these
sweet knaves
Into baboon and monkey.
Sir
Most hungerly on your sight.
Right welcome
Ere we depart
In different pleasures. Pray you
Exeunt all except APEMANTUS
Enter two Lords
What time o' day is't
Time to be honest.
That time serves still.
The more accursed thou
Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
Ay
Fare thee well
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
Why
Shouldst have kept one to thyself
give thee none.
Hang thyself!
No
requests to thy friend.
Away
I will fly
Exit
He's opposite to humanity. Come
The very heart of kindness.
He pours it out; Plutus
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
All use of quittance.
The noblest mind he carries
That ever govern'd man.
Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
I'll keep you company.
Exeunt
SCENE II. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet  served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter  TIMON
Most honour'd Timon
He is gone happy
Then
To your free heart
I derived liberty.
O
I gave it freely ever; and there's none
Can truly say he gives
If our betters play at that game
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.
A noble spirit!
Nay
Ceremony was but devised at first
To set a gloss on faint deeds
But where there is true friendship
Pray
Than my fortunes to me.
They sit
My lord
Ho
O
No;
You shall not make me welcome:
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
Fie
Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
They say
man is ever angry. Go
himself
he fit for't
Let me stay at thine apperil
observe; I give thee warning on't.
I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian
prithee
I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me
ne'er flatter thee. O you gods
men eat Timon
to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
and all the madness is
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
Methinks they should invite them without knives;
Good for their meat
There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
next him now
breath of him in a divided draught
man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
huge man
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
My lord
Let it flow this way
Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides
well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
look ill
be a sinner
This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
Apemantus' grace.
Immortal gods
I pray for no man but myself:
Grant I may never prove so fond
Or a harlot
Or a dog
Or a keeper with my freedom;
Or my friends
Amen. So fall to't:
Rich men sin
Eats and drinks
Much good dich thy good heart
Captain Alcibiades
My heart is ever at your service
You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
dinner of friends.
So the were bleeding-new
like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then
Might we but have that happiness
would once use our hearts
some part of our zeals
for ever perfect.
O
themselves have provided that I shall have much help
from you: how had you been my friends else? why
have you that charitable title from thousands
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty
speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
you. O you gods
friends
were the most needless creatures living
ne'er have use for 'em
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
sounds to themselves. Why
myself poorer
are born to do benefits: and what better or
properer can we can our own than the riches of our
friends? O
so many
fortunes! O joy
Mine eyes cannot hold out water
forget their faults
Thou weepest to make them drink
Joy had the like conception in our eyes
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
Ho
I promise you
Much!
Tucket
What means that trump?
Enter a Servant
How now?
Please you
ladies most desirous of admittance.
Ladies! what are their wills?
There comes with them a forerunner

I pray
Enter Cupid
Hail to thee
That of his bounties taste! The five best senses
Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.
They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:
Music
Exit Cupid
You see
Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies  as Amazons
Hoy-day
They dance! they are mad women.
Like madness is the glory of this life.
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
We make ourselves fools
And spend our flatteries
Upon whose age we void it up again
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
Who dies
Of their friends' gift?
I should fear those that dance before me now
Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
The Lords rise from table
You have done our pleasures much grace
You have added worth unto 't and lustre
I am to thank you for 't.

Be worthily entertain'd.
Enter a third Servant
How now! what news?
Please you
gentleman
to-morrow to hunt with him
two brace of greyhounds.
I'll hunt with him; and let them be received
[Aside]                What will this come to?
He commands us to provide
Nor will he know his purse
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
For every word: he is so kind that he now
Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.
Well
Before I were forced out!
Happier is he that has no friend to feed
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
I bleed inwardly for my lord.
Exit
You do yourselves
Much wrong
Here
With more than common thanks I will receive it.
O
And now I remember
Good words the other day of a bay courser
I rode on: it is yours
O
You may take my word
Can justly praise but what he does affect:
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.
O
I take all and your several visitations
So kind to heart
Methinks
It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
Is 'mongst the dead
Lie in a pitch'd field.
Ay
We are so virtuously bound--
And so
Am I to you.
So infinitely endear'd--
All to you. Lights
The best of happiness
Ready for his friends.
Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON
What a coil's here!
Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
Methinks
Now
good to thee.
No
thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long
paper shortly: what need these feasts
vain-glories?
Nay
sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come
with better music.
Exit
So:
Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:
I'll lock thy heaven from thee.

In giving him his right.

Nay

And I am sent expressly to your lordship.
Give me breath.
I do beseech you
I'll wait upon you instantly.

You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
Had you not fully laid my state before me
You would not hear me
Go to:
Perchance some single vantages you took.
When my indispos ition put you back:
And that unaptness made your minister
O my good lord
When
Return so much
Yea
To hold your hand more close: I did endure
Not seldom
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts. My loved lord
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts.
Let all my land be sold.
'Tis all engaged
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Of present dues: the future comes apace:
What shall defend the interim? and at length
How goes our reckoning?
To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
O my good lord
Were it all yours to give it in a breath
You tell me true.
If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me
With riotous feeders
With drunken spilth of wine
Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy
Prithee
Heavens
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
What heart
Lord Timon's?
Great Timon
Ah
Feast-won
Come
No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
Unwisely
Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack
If I would broach the vessels of my love
As I can bid thee speak.
Assurance bless your thoughts!
And
Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!
Enter FLAMINIUS
My lord? my lord?
I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;
to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour
to-day: you
loves
found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let
the request be fifty talents.
As you have said
[Aside]  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!
Go you
Of whom
Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant
A thousand talents to me.
I have been bold--
For that I knew it the most general way--
To them to use your signet and your name;
But they do shake their heads
No richer in return.
Is't true? can't be?
They answer
Do what they would; are sorry--you are honourable
But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--
Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--
And so
They froze me into silence.
You gods
Prithee
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
Their blood is caked
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
And nature
To a Servant
Go to Ventidius.
To FLAVIUS
Prithee
No blame belongs to thee.
To Servant
Ventidius lately
Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd
Into a great estate: when he was poor
Bid him suppose some good necessity
Touches his friend
With those five talents.
Exit Servant
To FLAVIUS
That had
To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak
I would I could not think it: that thought is
bounty's foe;
Being free itself
Exeunt
ACT III
SCENE I. A room in Lucullus' house.
FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him
I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
I thank you
Enter LUCULLUS
Here's my lord.
[Aside]  One of Lord Timon's men? a gift
warrant. Why
basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius
Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome
Fill me some wine.
Exit Servants
And how does that honourable
gentleman of Athens
and master?
His health is well sir.
I am right glad that his health is well
what hast thou there under thy cloak
'Faith
lord's behalf
supply; who
use fifty talents
furnish him
assistance therein.
La
keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'
dined with him
supper to him
by my coming. Every man has his fault
is his: I ha' told him on't
him from't.
Re-enter Servant
Please your lordship
Flaminius
Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what
belongs to reason; and canst use the time well
the time use thee well: good parts in thee.
To Servant
Get you gone
Exit Servant
Draw nearer
bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou
knowest well enough
bare friendship
solidares for thee: good boy
thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.
Is't possible the world should so much differ
Throwing the money back
Ha! now I see thou art a fool
Exit
May these add to the number that may scald thee!
Let moulten coin be thy damnation
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
O
And
Which my lord paid for
To expel sickness
Exit
SCENE II. A public place.
Enter LUCILIUS
Who
an honourable gentleman.
We know him for no less
to him. But I can tell you one thing
which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
happy hours are done and past
shrinks from him.
Fie
But believe you this
so many talents
showed what necessity belonged to't
How!
I tell you
What a strange case was that! now
there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
part
small kindnesses from him
and such-like trifles
yet
ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.
Enter SERVILIUS
See
I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord
To LUCIUS
Servilius! you are kindly met
commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord
exquisite friend.
May it please your honour
Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank
him
Has only sent his present occasion now
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
with so many talents.
I know his lordship is but merry with me;
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
But in the mean time he wants less
If his occasion were not virtuous
Dost thou speak seriously
Upon my soul
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
against such a good time
myself honourable! how unluckily it happened
should purchase the day before for a little part
beast
myself
not
Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me
this from me
afflictions
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius
befriend me so far
Yes
I'll look you out a good turn
Exit SERVILIUS
True as you said
And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
Exit
Do you observe this
Ay
Why
same piece
Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
His friend that dips in the same dish? for
My knowing
Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks
And yet--O
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
He does deny him
Religion groans at it.
For mine own part
And honourable carriage
For policy sits above conscience.
Exeunt
SCENE III. A room in Sempronius' house.
Enter SEMPRONIUS
Must he needs trouble me in 't
all others?
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
And now Ventidius is wealthy too
Owe their estates unto him.
My lord
They have au denied him.
How! have they denied him?
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
And does he send to me? Three? hum!
It shows but little love or judgment in him:
Must I be his last refuge! His friends
physicians
Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him
For
That e'er received gift from him:
And does he think so backwardly of me now
So it may prove an argument of laughter
To the rest
I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum
I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
Exit
Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
devil knew not what he did when he made man
politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot
think but
set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked
whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
politic love.
This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled
Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
Now to guard sure their master.
And this is all a liberal course allows;
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.

SCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.
Enter two Servants of Varro
Varro's
Well met; good morrow
The like to you kind Varro.
Lucius!
What
"Lucilius' Servant	Ay"
One business does command us all; for mine Is money.
So is theirs and ours.
Enter PHILOTUS
"Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!"
Good day at once.
"Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome"
What do you think the hour?
Labouring for nine.
"Lucilius' Servant	So much?"
Is not my lord seen yet?
"Lucilius' Servant	Not yet."
I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
"Lucilius' Servant	Ay"
You must consider that a prodigal course
Is like the sun's; but not
I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
That is one may reach deep enough
Find little.
I am of your fear for that.
I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
Your lord sends now for money.
Most true
And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift
It is against my heart.
"Lucilius' Servant	Mark"
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
I'm weary of this charge
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth
Varro's
Yes
"Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine."
Varro's
'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun
Else
Enter FLAMINIUS.
One of Lord Timon's men.
"Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius! Sir"
come forth?
No
We attend his lordship; pray
I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.
Exit
Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak
"Lucilius' Servant	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?"
He goes away in a cloud: call him
Do you hear
Varro's
By your leave
What do ye ask of me
We wait for certain money here
Ay
Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
And take down the interest into their
gluttonous maws.
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
Let me pass quietly:
Believe 't
I have no more to reckon
"Lucilius' Servant	Ay"
If 'twill not serve
For you serve knaves.
Exit
Varro's
How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
Varro's
No matter what; he's poor
enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
house to put his head in? such may rail against
great buildings.
Enter SERVILIUS
O
If I might beseech you
other hour
discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;
he's much out of health
Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
And
Good gods!
We cannot take this for answer
[Within]  Servilius
Enter TIMON
What
Have I been ever free
Be my retentive enemy
The place which I have feasted
"Lucilius' Servant	Put in now"
My lord
"Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine."
And mine
Both
"Varro's Servants	And ours"
All our bills.
Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
"Lucilius' Servant	Alas"
Cut my heart in sums.

Five thousand drops pays that.

What if it should be so?
My lord
I'll have it so. My steward!
Here
So fitly? Go
All
I'll once more feast the rascals.
O my lord
There is not so much left
A moderate table.
Be't not in thy care; go
Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.

SCENE V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.
My lord
Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
Most true; the law shall bruise him.
Enter ALCIBIADES
Honour
Now
I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
For pity is the virtue of the law
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine
To those that
He is a man
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
An honour in him which buys out his fault--
But with a noble fury and fair spirit
And with such sober and unnoted passion
He did behave his anger
You undergo too strict a paradox
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
Upon the head of valour; which indeed
Is valour misbegot and came into the world
When sects and factions were newly born:
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
The worst that man can breathe
His outsides
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
My lord
You cannot make gross sins look clear:
To revenge is no valour
My lords
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle
Such valour in the bearing
Abroad? why then
That stay at home
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
To kill
But
To be in anger is impiety;
But who is man that is not angry?
Weigh but the crime with this.
You breathe in vain.
In vain! his service done
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
Were a sufficient briber for his life.
What's that?
I say
How full of valour did he bear himself
In the last conflict
He has made too much plenty with 'em;
He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
Drowns him
If there were no foes
To overcome him: in that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages
He dies.
Hard fate! he might have died in war.
My lords
Though his right arm might purchase his own time
And be in debt to none--yet
And
Security
My honours to you
If by this crime he owes the law his life
For law is strict
We are for law: he dies; urge it no more
Must it be so? it must not be. My lords
How!
Call me to your remembrances.
What!
I cannot think but your age has forgot me;
It could not else be
My wounds ache at you.
Do you dare our anger?
'Tis in few words
We banish thee for ever.
Banish me!
Banish your dotage; banish usury
If
our spirit
Exeunt Senators
Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live
Only in bone
I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes
Their coin upon large interest
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury
My discontented troops
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
Exit
SCENE VI. The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.  Enter divers Lords
The good time of day to you
I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
did but try us this other day.
Upon that were my thoughts tiring
encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.
It should not be
I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest
inviting
to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them
I must needs appear.
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
business
sorry
provision was out.
I am sick of that grief too
things go.
Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
you?
A thousand pieces.
A thousand pieces!
What of you?
He sent to me
Enter TIMON and Attendants
With all my heart
Ever at the best
The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
your lordship.
[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter; such
summer-birds are men. Gentlemen
recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
music awhile
trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.
I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
that I returned you an empty messenger.
O
My noble lord
Ah
My most honourable lord
Think not on 't
If you had sent but two hours before
Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
The banquet brought in
Come
All covered dishes!
Royal cheer
Doubt not that
it.
How do you? What's the news?
Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?
Alcibiades banished!
'Tis so
How! how!
I pray you
My worthy friends
I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
This is the old man still.
Will 't hold? will 't hold?
It does: but time will--and so--
I do conceive.
Each man to his stool
the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
places alike. Make not a city feast of it
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
sit
You great benefactors
thankfulness. For your own gifts
praised: but reserve still to give
deities be despised. Lend to each man enough
one need not lend to another; for
godheads to borrow of men
gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
the table
rest of your fees
amiss in them
destruction. For these my present friends
are to me nothing
nothing are they welcome.
Uncover
The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water
What does his lordship mean?
I know not.
May you a better feast never behold
Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
Who
Your reeking villany.
Throwing the water in their faces
Live loathed and long
Of man and beast the infinite malady
Crust you quite o'er! What
Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
Stay
Throws the dishes at them
What
Burn
Of Timon man and all humanity!
Exit
Re-enter the Lords
How now
Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
Push! did you see my cap?
I have lost my gown.
He's but a mad lord
He gave me a jewel th' other day
beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?
Did you see my cap?
Here 'tis.
Here lies my gown.
Let's make no stay.
Lord Timon's mad.
I feel 't upon my bones.
One day he gives us diamonds

ACT IV
SCENE I. Without the walls of Athens.
Enter TIMON
Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall
Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools
Convert o' the instant
Rather than render back
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are
Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen
On Athens
As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth
Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath
merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee
Take thou that too
Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
The gods confound--hear me
The Athenians both within and out that wall!
And grant
To the whole race of mankind
Exit
SCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon's house.
Enter FLAVIUS
Hear you
Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?
Alack
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods
Such a house broke!
So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not
One friend to take his fortune by the arm
As we do turn our backs
From our companion thrown into his grave
Slink all away
Enter other Servants
All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;
That see I by our faces; we are fellows still
Into this sea of air.
Good fellows all
Wherever we shall meet
Nay
Thus part we rich in sorrow
Servants embrace
O
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt
Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
But in a dream of friendship?
To have his pomp and all what state compounds
But only painted
Poor honest lord
Who
For bounty
My dearest lord
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
Of monstrous friends
Supply his life
I'll follow and inquire him out:
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
Whilst I have gold
Exit
SCENE III. Woods and cave
Enter TIMON
O blessed breeding sun
Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature
Raise me this beggar
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
There's nothing level in our cursed natures
All feasts
His semblable
Destruction fang mankind! Earth
Digging
Who seeks for better of thee
With thy most operant poison! What is here?
Gold? yellow
Thus much of this will make black white
Ha
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides
This yellow slave
Will knit and break religions
And give them title
With senators on the bench: this is it
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
She
Would cast the gorge at
To the April day again. Come
Among the route of nations
Do thy right nature.
March afar off
Ha! a drum ? Thou'rt quick
Nay
Keeping some gold
Enter ALCIBIADES
What art thou there? speak.
A beast
What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee
I am Misanthropos
For thy part
I know thee well;
But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
I know thee too; and more than that I know thee
With man's blood paint the ground
Religious canons
Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword
Thy lips rot off!
I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
To thine own lips again.
How came the noble Timon to this change?
As the moon does
But then renew I could not
There were no suns to borrow of.
Noble Timon
None
Maintain my opinion.
What is it
Promise me friendship
wilt not promise
a man! if thou dost perform
thou art a man!
I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
Thou saw'st them
I see them now; then was a blessed time.
As thine is now
Is this the Athenian minion
Voiced so regardfully?
Art thou Timandra?
Yes.
Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
Give them diseases
Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
To the tub-fast and the diet.
Hang thee
Pardon him
Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
I have but little gold of late
In my penurious band: I have heard
I prithee
I am thy friend
How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
I had rather be alone.
Why
Here is some gold for thee.
Keep it
When I have laid proud Athens on a heap
Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
Ay
The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
And thee after
Why me
That
Put up thy gold: go on
Be as a planetary plague
Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
It is her habit only that is honest
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps
Think it a bastard
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
Whose proof
Make large confusion; and
Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
givest me
Dost thou
upon thee!
Give us some gold
Enough to make a whore forswear her trade
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
The immortal gods that hear you
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you
Let your close fire predominate his smoke
With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face
Well
Believe't
Consumptions sow
In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins
Of him that
ruffians bald;
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
Derive some pain from you: plague all;
That your activity may defeat and quell
The source of all erection. There's more gold:
Do you damn others
More counsel with more money
More whore
Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell
If I thrive well
If I hope well
I never did thee harm.
Yes
Call'st thou that harm?
Men daily find it. Get thee away
Thy beagles with thee.
We but offend him. Strike!
Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES
That nature
Whose womb unmeasurable
Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;

Go great with tigers
Teem with new monsters
Hath to the marbled mansion all above
Never presented!--O
Dry up thy marrows
Whereof ungrateful man
And morsels unctuous
Enter APEMANTUS
More man? plague
I was directed hither: men report
Thou dost affect my manners
'Tis
This is in thee a nature but infected;
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
Thy flatterers yet wear silk
Hug their diseased perfumes
That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods
Be thou a flatterer now
By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee
Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again
Were I like thee
Thou hast cast away thyself
A madman so long
That the bleak air
cold brook
Whose naked natures live in an the spite
Of wreakful heaven
O
A fool of thee: depart.
I love thee better now than e'er I did.
I hate thee worse.
Why?
Thou flatter'st misery.
I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.
Why dost thou seek me out?
To vex thee.
Always a villain's office or a fool's.
Dost please thyself in't?
Ay.
What! a knave too?
If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
To castigate thy pride
Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again
Outlives encertain pomp
The one is filling still
The other
Thou shouldst desire to die
Not by his breath that is more miserable.
Thou art a slave
With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
Hadst thou
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
To such as may the passive drugs of it
Freely command
In general riot; melted down thy youth
In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
The icy precepts of respect
The sugar'd game before thee. But myself
At duty
Do on the oak
Fell from their boughs and left me open
For every storm that blows: I
Thy nature did commence in sufferance
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
If thou wilt curse
To some she beggar and compounded thee
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men
Art thou proud yet?
Ay
I
No prodigal.
I
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee
That the whole life of Athens were in this!
Thus would I eat it.
Eating a root
Here; I will mend thy feast.
Offering him a root
First mend my company
So I shall mend mine own
'Tis not well mended so
if not
What wouldst thou have to Athens?
Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt
Here is no use for gold.
The best and truest;
For here it sleeps
Where liest o' nights
Under that's above me.
Where feed'st thou o' days
Where my stomach finds meat; or
it.
Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
Where wouldst thou send it?
To sauce thy dishes.
The middle of humanity thou never knewest
extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
and thy perfume
curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none
despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
thee
On what I hate I feed not.
Dost hate a medlar?
Ay
An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner
have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
Who
ever know beloved?
Myself.
I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a
dog.
What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
to thy flatterers?
Women nearest; but men
themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world
Give it the beasts
Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
men
Ay
A beastly ambition
attain to! If thou wert the lion
beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb
eat three: if thou wert the fox
suspect thee
the ass: if thou wert the ass
torment thee
breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf
greediness would afflict thee
hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
unicorn
make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
thou a bear
wert thou a horse
leopard: wert thou a leopard
the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
defence absence. What beast couldst thou be
were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
thou already
transformation!
If thou couldst please me with speaking to me
mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
Athens is become a forest of beasts.
How has the ass broke the wall
Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
and give way: when I know not what else to do
see thee again.
When there is nothing living but thee
welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
If I name thee.
I'll beat thee
I would my tongue could rot them off!
Away
Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
I swound to see thee.
Would thou wouldst burst!
Away
A stone by thee.
Throws a stone at him
Beast!
Slave!
Toad!
Rogue
I am sick of this false world
But even the mere necessities upon 't.
Then
Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph
To the gold
O thou sweet king-killer
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
Thou ever young
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god
every tongue
Think
Set them into confounding odds
May have the world in empire!
Would 'twere so!
But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:
Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
Throng'd to!
Ay.

Long live so

Where should he have this gold? It is some poor

friends
It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not
for't
reserve it
True; for he bears it not about him
Is not this he?
Where?
'Tis his description.
He; I know him.
Save thee
Now
Soldiers
Both too; and women's sons.
We are not thieves
Your greatest want is
Why should you want? Behold
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
The oaks bear mast
The bounteous housewife
Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
We cannot live on grass
Nor on the beasts themselves
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
That you are thieves profess'd
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
In limited professions. Rascal thieves
His antidotes are poison
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
Do villany
The sun's a thief
Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief
The sea's a thief
The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief
From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
The laws
Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go
I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.
Has almost charmed me from my profession
persuading me to it.
'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.
I'll believe him as an enemy
Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
so miserable but a man may be true.
Exeunt Banditti
Enter FLAVIUS
O you gods!
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
Full of decay and failing? O monument
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
What an alteration of honour
Has desperate want made!
What viler thing upon the earth than friends
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
How rarely does it meet with this time's guise
Grant I may ever love
Those that would mischief me than those that do!
Has caught me in his eye: I will present
My honest grief unto him; and
Away! what art thou?
Have you forgot me
Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
Then
An honest poor servant of yours.
Then I know thee not:
I never had honest man about me
I kept were knaves
The gods are witness
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
What
love thee
Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
Strange times
I beg of you to know me
To entertain me as your steward still.
Had I a steward
So true
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
Let me behold thy face. Surely
Was born of woman.
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness
One honest man--mistake me not--but one;
No more
How fain would I have hated all mankind!
And thou redeem'st thyself: but all
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
For
For many so arrive at second masters
For I must ever doubt
Is not thy kindness subtle
No
Doubt and suspect
You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
That which I show
For this one wish
To requite me
Look thee
Have sent thee treasure. Go
But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
Hate all
What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em
blasted woods
And so farewell and thrive.
O
If thou hatest curses
Ne'er see thou man
Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave
ACT V
SCENE I. The woods. Before Timon's cave.
Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching them from his cave
As I took note of the place
he abides.
What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
for true
Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
again
'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him
supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
what they travail for
that goes of his having.
What have you now to present unto him?
Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
promise him an excellent piece.
I must serve him so too
that's coming toward him.
Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
performance is ever the duller for his act; and
deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
of will or testament which argues a great sickness
in his judgment that makes it.
TIMON comes from his cave
[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a
man so bad as is thyself.
I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire
against the softness of prosperity
of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in
thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
other men? Do so
Nay
Then do we sin against our own estate
True;
When the day serves
[Aside]  I'll meet you at the turn. What a
god's gold
Than where swine feed!
'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!
Fit I meet them.
Coming forward
Hail
Our late noble master!
Have I once lived to see two honest men?
Sir
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:
What! to you
To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
With any size of words.
Let it go naked
You that are honest
He and myself
Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts
Ay
We are hither come to offer you our service.
Most honest men! Why
Can you eat roots
What we can do
Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;
I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.
So it is said
Came not my friend nor I.
Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
Best in all Athens: thou'rt
Thou counterfeit'st most lively.
So
E'en so
That thou art even natural in thine art.
But
Marry
You take much pains to mend.
Beseech your honour
To make it known to us.
You'll take it ill.
Most thankfully
Will you
Doubt it not
There's never a one of you but trusts a knave
Do we
Ay
That he's a made-up villain.
I know none such
Nor I.
Look you
Hang them or stab them
Name them
You that way and you this
Each man apart
If where thou art two villains shall not be
But where one villain is
Hence
To Painter
You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!
To Poet
You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
Out
Beats them out
Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators
It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;
For he is set so only to himself
That nothing but himself which looks like man
Is friendly with him.
Bring us to his cave:
It is our part and promise to the Athenians
To speak with Timon.
At all times alike
Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
That framed him thus: time
Here is his cave.
Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
Look out
Speak to them
TIMON comes from his cave
Thou sun
be hang'd:
For each true word
Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue
Worthy Timon
Of none but such as you
The senators of Athens greet thee
I thank them; and would send them back the plague
O
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
The senators with one consent of love
Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
On special dignities
For thy best use and wearing.
They confess
Toward thee forgetfulness too general
Which now the public body
Play the recanter
A lack of Timon's aid
Of its own fail
And send forth us
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
Ay
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
And write in thee the figures of their love
You witch me in it;
Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes
Therefore
And of our Athens
The captainship
Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild
His country's peace.
And shakes his threatening sword
Against the walls of Athens.
Therefore
Well
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen
Of contumelious
But I do prize it at my love before
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
To the protection of the prosperous gods
Stay not
Why
it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
Of health and living now begins to mend
Be Alcibiades your plague
We speak in vain.
But yet I love my country
One that rejoices in the common wreck
That's well spoke.
Commend me to my loving countrymen
These words become your lips as they pass
thorough them.
And enter in our ears like great triumphers
In their applauding gates.
Commend me to them
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
In life's uncertain voyage
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
I like this well; he will return again.
I have a tree
From high to low throughout
To stop affliction
Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
Come not to me again: but say to Athens
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
Who once a day with his embossed froth
The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come
Lips
What is amiss plague and infection mend!
Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
Sun
Retires to his cave
His discontents are unremoveably
Coupled to nature.
Our hope in him is dead: let us return
In our dear peril.
It requires swift foot.
Exeunt
SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.
Enter two Senators and a Messenger
Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
As full as thy report?
have spoke the least:
Besides
Present approach.
We stand much hazard
I met a courier
Whom
From Alcibiades to Timon's cave
His fellowship i' the cause against your city
Here come our brothers.
Enter the Senators from TIMON
No talk of Timon
The enemies' drum is heard
Doth choke the air with dust: in
Ours is the fall
Exeunt
SCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave
Enter a Soldier
By all description this should be the place.
Who's here? speak
Timon is dead
Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.
Dead
I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
Our captain hath in every figure skill
Before proud Athens he's set down by this
Exit
SCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens.
Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers
Sound to this coward and lascivious town
Our terrible approach.
A parley sounded
Enter Senators on the walls
Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
With all licentious measure
The scope of justice; till now myself and such
As slept within the shadow of your power
Hav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush
Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease
With fear and horrid flight.
Noble and young
Above their quantity.
So did we woo
Transformed Timon to our city's love
By humble message and by promised means:
We were not all unkind
The common stroke of war.
These walls of ours
Were not erected by their hands from whom
You have received your griefs; nor are they such
That these great towers
should fall
For private faults in them.
Nor are they living
Who were the motives that you first went out;
Shame that they wanted cunning
Hath broke their hearts. March
By decimation
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth
Let die the spotted.
All have not offended;
For those that were
On those that are
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
With those that have offended: like a shepherd
What thou wilt
Than hew to't with thy sword.
Set but thy foot
Against our rampired gates
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
Throw thy glove
And not as our confusion
Shall make their harbour in our town
Have seal'd thy full desire.
Then there's my glove;
Descend
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Fall and no more: and
With my more noble meaning
Shall pass his quarter
Of regular justice in your city's bounds
At heaviest answer.
'Tis most nobly spoken.
Descend
The Senators descend
Enter Soldier
My noble general
Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
And on his grave-stone this insculpture
With wax I brought away
Interprets for my poor ignorance.
[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a
wretched corse
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
caitiffs left!
Here lie I
Pass by and curse thy fill
not here thy gait.'
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs
droplets which
From niggard nature fall
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
On thy low grave
Is noble Timon: of whose memory
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
Let our drums strike.
Exeunt
ACT I
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol.
The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes  and Senators aloft. Enter
Noble patricians
I am his first-born son
That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
Then let my father's honours live in me
Romans
And suffer not dishonour to approach
The imperial seat
But let desert in pure election shine
Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS
Princes
Ambitiously for rule and empery
A special party
For many good and great deserts to Rome:
A nobler man
He by the senate is accit'd home
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
That
Ten years are spent since first he undertook
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
Bleeding to Rome
In coffins from the field;
And now at last
Let us entreat
And in the Capitol and senate's right
Dismiss your followers and
How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
Marcus Andronicus
In thy uprightness and integrity
Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS
Friends
Commit myself
Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS

As I am confident and kind to thee.
Open the gates
Tribunes
Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol
Enter a Captain

Patron of virtue
From where he circumscribed with his sword
Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and  MUTIUS; After them
Hail
Lo
From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage
Thou great defender of this Capitol
Romans
These that survive let Rome reward with love;
These that I bring unto their latest home
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
Titus
Make way to lay them by their brethren.
The tomb is opened
There greet in silence
O sacred receptacle of my joys
Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
That so the shadows be not unappeased
I give him you
Stay
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
O
Were piety in thine
Andronicus
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
Draw near them then in being merciful:
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
Thrice noble Titus
Patient yourself
These are their brethren
Alive and dead
Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
To this your son is mark'd
Away with him! and make a fire straight;
And with our swords
Exeunt LUCIUS
O cruel
Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive
To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
Then
The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
With opportunity of sharp revenge
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
Re-enter LUCIUS
See
Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd
Remaineth nought
Let it be so; and let Andronicus
Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
Trumpets sounded
In peace and honour rest you here
Rome's readiest champions
Here lurks no treason
In peace and honour rest you here
Enter LAVINIA
In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
My noble lord and father
Lo
I render
And at thy feet I kneel
O
Kind Rome
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
Lavinia
Enter
Long live Lord Titus
Thanks
And welcome
Fair lords
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp
And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
Titus Andronicus
And name thee in election for the empire
Be candidatus then
A better head her glorious body fits
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:
What should I don this robe
Be chosen with proclamations to-day
Rome
Give me a staff of honour for mine age
Upright he held it
Titus
Proud and ambitious tribune
Patience
Romans
Patricians
Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
Andronicus
Proud Saturnine
That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
Content thee
The people's hearts
Andronicus
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends
Of noble minds is honourable meed.
People of Rome
Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
To gratify the good Andronicus
Tribunes
Then
With voices and applause of every sort
Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor
A long flourish till they come down
Titus Andronicus
To us in our election this day
And
Thy name and honourable family
Tell me
It doth
I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine
My sword
Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:
Receive them then
Thanks
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
Rome shall record
The least of these unspeakable deserts
[To TAMORA]  Now
an emperor;
To him that
A goodly lady
That I would choose
Clear up
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer
Princely shall be thy usage every way.
Rest on my word
Daunt all your hopes: madam
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
Lavinia
Not I
Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
Thanks
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
Proclaim our honours
Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show
Lord Titus
Seizing LAVINIA
How
Ay
To do myself this reason and this right.
'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:
This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
And that he will
Traitors

Surprised! by whom?
By him that justly may
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.

Exit
No
I'll trust
Thee never
Was there none else in Rome to make a stale
O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
But go thy ways; go
To him that flourish'd for her with his sword
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons
These words are razors to my wounded heart.
And therefore
Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome
And here I swear by all the Roman gods
And tapers burn so bright and every thing
In readiness for Hymenaeus stand
I lead espoused my bride along with me.
And here
Ascend
Your noble emperor and his lovely bride
There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
Exeunt all but TITUS
I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
Titus
Re-enter MARCUS
O Titus
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
No
That hath dishonour'd all our family;
Unworthy brother
But let us give him burial
Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
Traitors
This monument five hundred years hath stood
Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
My lord
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him
He must be buried with his brethren.
And shall
'And shall!' what villain was it that spake
that word?
He that would vouch it in any place but here.
What
No
To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
Marcus
My foes I do repute you every one;
So
He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
Not I
MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel
Brother
Father
Speak thou no more
Renowned Titus
Dear father
Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
His noble nephew here in virtue's nest
Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
Did graciously plead for his funerals:
Let not young Mutius
Be barr'd his entrance here.
Rise
The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw
Well
MUTIUS is put into the tomb
There lie thy bones
[Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
My lord
Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
I know not
Is she not then beholding to the man
That brought her for this high good turn so far?
Yes
Flourish. Re-enter
So
God give you joy
And you of yours
Traitor
Rape
But let the laws of Rome determine all;
Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.
'Tis good
But
My lord
Only thus much I give your grace to know:
By all the duties that I owe to Rome
That in the rescue of Lavinia
With his own hand did slay his youngest son
To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
Receive him
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
Prince Bassianus
'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
My worthy lord
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine
And at my suit
What
Not so
I should be author to dishonour you!
But on mine honour dare I undertake
For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:
Then
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose
Aside to SATURNINUS
be won at last;
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
You are but newly planted in your throne;
Lest
I'll find a day to massacre them all
And raze their faction and their family
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.
Aloud
Come
Take up this good old man
That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
Rise
I thank your majesty
These words
Titus
This day all quarrels die
And let it be mine honour
For you
My word and promise to the emperor
And fear not lords
By my advice
We do
That
Away
Nay
The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;
I will not be denied: sweet heart
Marcus
Lavinia
I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
Come
This day shall be a love-day
To-morrow
To hunt the panther and the hart with me
Be it so
Flourish. Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Palace.
Enter AARON
Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top
Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.
As when the golden sun salutes the morn
So Tamora:
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
Then
Hast prisoner held
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
I will be bright
To wait
Holloa! what storm is this?
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
Chiron
And may
Demetrius
And so in this
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
I am as able and as fit as thou
To serve
And that my sword upon thee shall approve
[Aside]  Clubs
the peace.
Why
Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
Till you know better how to handle it.
Meanwhile
Ay
They draw
[Coming forward]  Why
So near the emperor's palace dare you draw
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
I would not for a million of gold
The cause were known to them it most concerns;
Nor would your noble mother for much more
Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.
For shame
Not I
My rapier in his bosom and withal
Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.
For that I am prepared and full resolved.
Foul-spoken coward
Away
Now
Why
It is to jet upon a prince's right?
What
Without controlment
Young lords
This discord's ground
I care not
I love Lavinia more than all the world.
Youngling
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
Why
How furious and impatient they be
I tell you
By this device.
Aaron
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
To achieve her! how?
Why makest thou it so strange?
She is a woman
She is a woman
She is Lavinia
What
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive
Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.
Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
[Aside]  Ay
Then why should he despair that knows to court it
With words
What
Why
Would serve your turns.
Ay
Aaron
Would you had hit it too!
Then should not we be tired with this ado.
Why
To square for this? would it offend you
That both should speed?
Faith
Nor me
For shame
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
That you affect; and so must you resolve
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
Than this Lavinia
A speedier course than lingering languishment
Must we pursue
My lords
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
The forest walks are wide and spacious;
And many unfrequented plots there are
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
Single you thither then this dainty doe
This way
Come
To villany and vengeance consecrate
And she shall file our engines with advice
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame
The woods are ruthless
There speak
your turns;
There serve your lusts
Thy counsel
To cool this heat
Per Styga
Exeunt
SCENE II. A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard.
Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS
The hunt is up
Uncouple here and let us make a bay
And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal
Sons
I have been troubled in my sleep this night
A cry of hounds and horns
Many good morrows to your majesty;
Madam
I promised your grace a hunter's peal.
And you have rung it lustily
Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.
Lavinia
I say
I have been broad awake two hours and more.
Come on
To TAMORA
Madam
Our Roman hunting.
I have dogs
And I have horse will follow where the game
Makes way
Chiron
Exeunt
SCENE III. A lonely part of the forest.
Enter AARON
He that had wit would think that I had none
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem
A very excellent piece of villany:
And so repose
Hides the gold
That have their alms out of the empress' chest.
Enter TAMORA
My lovely Aaron
The birds chant melody on every bush
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:
Under their sweet shade
And
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
Be unto us as is a nurse's song
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
Madam
What signifies my deadly-standing eye
Even as an adder when she doth unroll
To do some fatal execution?
No
Vengeance is in my heart
Hark Tamora
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
Seest thou this letter? take it up
Now question me no more; we are espied;
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
Ah
No more
Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
To back thy quarrels
Exit
Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA
Who have we here? Rome's royal empress
Or is it Dian
To see the general hunting in this forest?
Saucy controller of our private steps!
Had I the power that some say Dian had
With horns
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs
Under your patience
And to be doubted that your Moor and you
Are singled forth to try experiments:
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
Believe me
Doth make your honour of his body's hue
Why are you sequester'd from all your train
And wander'd hither to an obscure plot
And
For sauciness. I pray you
This valley fits the purpose passing well.
The king my brother shall have note of this.
Ay
Good king
Why have I patience to endure all this?
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
How now
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
Have I not reason
These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:
A barren detested vale
The trees
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit
As any mortal body hearing it
Should straight fall mad
No sooner had they told this hellish tale
Unto the body of a dismal yew
And then they call'd me foul adulteress
That ever ear did hear to such effect:
And
Revenge it
This is a witness that I am thy son.
Stabs BASSIANUS
And this for me
Also stabs BASSIANUS
Ay
Give me thy poniard; you shall know
Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
Stay
First thrash the corn
This minion stood upon her chastity
And shall she carry this unto her grave?
An if she do
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole
But when ye have the honey ye desire
I warrant you
Come
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face
I will not hear her speak; away with her!
Sweet lords
Listen
To see her tears; but be your heart to them
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
O
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
To CHIRON
Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.
What
'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:
Yet have I heard
The lion moved with pity did endure
To have his princely paws pared all away:
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children
O
I know not what it means; away with her!
O
slain thee
Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me
Remember
But fierce Andronicus would not relent;
Therefore
O Tamora
For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
What begg'st thou
'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
O
Do this
So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
No
Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
No grace? no womanhood? Ah
The blot and enemy to our general name!
Confusion fall--
Nay
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the  pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
Farewell
Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor
Exit
Re-enter AARON
Come on
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
My sight is very dull
And mine
Falls into the pit
What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this
As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
A very fatal place it seems to me.
Speak
O brother
That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
[Aside]  Now will I fetch the king to find them here
How these were they that made away his brother.
Exit
Why dost not comfort me
From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
To prove thou hast a true-divining heart
Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
O
Was I a child to fear I know not what.
Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here
If it be dark
Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
A precious ring
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
O brother
If fear hath made thee faint
Out of this fell devouring receptacle
Reach me thy hand
Or
Of this deep pit
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
Thy hand once more; I will not loose again
Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
Falls in
Enter SATURNINUS with AARON
Along with me: I'll see what hole is here
Say who art thou that lately didst descend
Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour
My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
He and his lady both are at the lodge
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
We know not where you left him all alive;
But
Re-enter TAMORA
Where is my lord the king?
Here
Where is thy brother Bassianus?
Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
Then all too late I bring this fatal writ
And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
She giveth SATURNINUS a letter
[Reads]  'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--
Sweet huntsman
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
Among the nettles at the elder-tree
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
Do this
O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
This is the pit
Look
That should have murdered Bassianus here.
My gracious lord
[To TITUS]  Two of thy whelps
bloody kind
Sirs
There let them bide until we have devised
Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
What
How easily murder is discovered!
High emperor
I beg this boon
If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
Who found this letter? Tamora
Andronicus himself did take it up.
I did
For
They shall be ready at your highness' will
To answer their suspicion with their lives.
Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
Some bring the murder'd body
Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
For
Andronicus
Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.
Come
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.
Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with LAVINIA
So
Write down thy mind
See
Go home
She hath no tongue to call
And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
An 'twere my case
If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
Enter MARCUS
Who is this? my niece
Cousin
If I do dream
If I do wake
Speak
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
Of her two branches
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
Alas
But
Ah
And
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
O
Sorrow concealed
Fair Philomela
But
A craftier Tereus
O
Tremble
Or
Which that sweet tongue hath made
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
Come
For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
Do not draw back
O
Exeunt
ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. A street.
Enter Judges
Hear me
For pity of mine age
In dangerous wars
For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;
And for these bitter tears
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;
Be pitiful to my condemned sons
For two and twenty sons I never wept
Lieth down; the Judges
For these
My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
O earth
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face
Enter LUCIUS
O reverend tribunes! O gentle
Unbind my sons
And let me say
O noble father
The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
Ah
Grave tribunes
My gracious lord
Why
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
Who
When I do weep
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
And
A stone is soft as wax
A stone is silent
Rises
But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
To rescue my two brothers from their death:
For which attempt the judges have pronounced
My everlasting doom of banishment.
O happy man! they have befriended thee.
Why
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
Tigers must prey
But me and mine: how happy art thou
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA
Titus
Or
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
Will it consume me? let me see it
This was thy daughter.
Why
Ay me
Faint-hearted boy
Speak
Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
What fool hath added water to the sea
My grief was at the height before thou camest
Give me a sword
For they have fought for Rome
And they have nursed this woe
In bootless prayer have they been held up
Now all the service I require of them
Is that the one will help to cut the other.
'Tis well
For hands
Speak
O
That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence
Sweet varied notes
O
O
That hath received some unrecuring wound.
It was my deer; and he that wounded her
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
For now I stand as one upon a rock
Environed with a wilderness of sea
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
Here stands my other son
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
Now I behold thy lively body so?
Thou hast no hands
Nor tongue
Thy husband he is dead: and for his death
Thy brothers are condemn'd
Look
When I did name her brothers
Stood on her cheeks
Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
Perchance because she knows them innocent.
If they did kill thy husband
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
No
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
Gentle Lavinia
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
Shall thy good uncle
How they are stain'd
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
Or shall we cut away our hands
Or shall we bite our tongues
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
What shall we do? let us
Sweet father
Patience
Ah
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
Ah
Mark
Had she a tongue to speak
That to her brother which I said to thee:
His napkin
O
Enter AARON
Titus Andronicus
Sends thee this word
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
Did ever raven sing so like a lark
With all my heart
Good Aaron
Stay
My youth can better spare my blood than you;
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
O
My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
To ransom my two nephews from their death;
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
Nay
My hand shall go.
By heaven
Sirs
Are meet for plucking up
Sweet father
And
Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
Then I'll go fetch an axe.
But I will use the axe.
Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS
Come hither
Lend me thy hand
[Aside]  If that be call'd deceit
But I'll deceive you in another sort
Cuts off TITUS's hand
Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS
Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.
Good Aaron
Tell him it was a hand that warded him
From thousand dangers; bid him bury it
More hath it merited; that let it have.
As for my sons
As jewels purchased at an easy price;
And yet dear too
I go
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
Aside
Their heads
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
Let fools do good
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.
Exit
O
If any power pities wretched tears
To LAVINIA
What
Do
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
O brother
Is not my sorrow deep
Then be my passions bottomless with them.
But yet let reason govern thy lament.
If there were reason for these miseries
When heaven doth weep
If the winds rage
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
I am the sea; hark
She is the weeping welkin
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
Then must my earth with her continual tears
Become a deluge
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes
Then give me leave
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
Enter a Messenger
Worthy Andronicus
For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
And here's thy hand
Thy griefs their sports
That woe is me to think upon thy woes
More than remembrance of my father's death.
Exit
Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily
These miseries are more than may be borne.
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;
But sorrow flouted at is double death.
Ah
That ever death should let life bear his name
LAVINIA kisses TITUS
Alas
As frozen water to a starved snake.
When will this fearful slumber have an end?
Now
Thou dost not slumber: see
Thy other banish'd son
Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother
Ah
Rend off thy silver hair
Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight
The closing up of our most wretched eyes;
Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
Ha
Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.
Why
Besides
And make them blind with tributary tears:
Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
For these two heads do seem to speak to me
Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
Even in their throats that have committed them.
Come
You heavy people
The vow is made. Come
And in this hand the other I will bear.
Lavinia
Bear thou my hand
As for thee
Thou art an exile
Hie to the Goths
And
Exeunt TITUS
Farewell Andronicus
Farewell
Farewell
O
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
If Lucius live
And make proud Saturnine and his empress
Beg at the gates
Now will I to the Goths
Exit
SCENE II. A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out.
Enter TITUS
So
Than will preserve just so much strength in us
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
Marcus
Thy niece and I
With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
Who
To LAVINIA
Thou map of woe
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating
Wound it with sighing
Or get some little knife between thy teeth
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
May run into that sink
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
Fie
Such violent hands upon her tender life.
How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?
Why
What violent hands can she lay on her life?
Ah
To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er
O
Fie
Come
Here is no drink! Hark
I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
She says she drinks no other drink but tears
Speechless complainer
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
Thou shalt not sigh
And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.
Good grandsire
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
Alas
Peace
MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife
What dost thou strike at
At that that I have kill'd
Out on thee
Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:
A deed of death done on the innocent
Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:
I see thou art not for my company.
Alas
But how
How would he hang his slender gilded wings
Poor harmless fly
kill'd him.
Pardon me
O
Give me thy knife
Flattering myself
Come hither purposely to poison me.--
There's for thyself
Ah
Yet
That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.
Alas
Come
I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee
Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
Come
Exeunt
ACT IV
SCENE I. Rome. Titus's garden.
Enter young LUCIUS
Help
Follows me every where
Good uncle Marcus
Alas
Stand by me
She loves thee
Ay
What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
Fear her not
See
Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
Ah
Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
My lord
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
Although
Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did
Which made me down to throw my books
Causeless
And
Lucius
LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall
How now
Some book there is that she desires to see.
Which is it
But thou art deeper read
Come
Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
I think she means that there was more than one
Confederate in the fact: ay
Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
Lucius
Grandsire
My mother gave it me.
For love of her that's gone
Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
Helping her
What would she find? Lavinia
This is the tragic tale of Philomel
And rape
See
Lavinia
Ay
O
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes
O
Give signs
but friends
Or slunk not Saturnine
Sit down
Apollo
My lord
This sandy plot is plain; guide
This after me
Without the help of any hand at all.
He writes his name with his staff
Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
Write thou good niece; and here display
Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain
She takes the staff in her mouth
O
'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'
What
Performers of this heinous
Magni Dominator poli
O
There is enough written upon this earth
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
My lord
And kneel
And swear with me
And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame
Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths
'Tis sure enough
But if you hunt these bear-whelps
The dam will wake; and
You are a young huntsman
And
Will blow these sands
I say
For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
Ay
For his ungrateful country done the like.
And
Come
Lucius
Presents that I intend to send them both:
Come
Ay
No
Lavinia
Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
Ay
Exeunt TITUS
O heavens
Marcus
Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;
But yet so just that he will not revenge.
Revenge
Exit
SCENE II. The same. A room in the palace.
Enter
Demetrius
He hath some message to deliver us.
Ay
My lords
Aside
And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
Gramercy
[Aside]  That you are both decipher'd
The goodliest weapons of his armoury
To gratify your honourable youth
And so I do
Your lordships
And so I leave you both:
Aside
like bloody villains.
Exeunt Young LUCIUS
What's here? A scroll; and written round about?
Let's see;
Reads
'Integer vitae
O
I read it in the grammar long ago.
Ay
Aside
Now
Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;
And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines
But were our witty empress well afoot
But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
And now
Led us to Rome
It did me good
To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
But me more good
Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
Had he not reason
Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
I would we had a thousand Roman dames
At such a bay
A charitable wish and full of love.
Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
And that would she for twenty thousand more.
Come
For our beloved mother in her pains.
[Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
Trumpets sound within
Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
Belike
Soft! who comes here?
Enter a Nurse
Good morr ow
O
Well
O gentle Aaron
Now help
Why
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
O
She is deliver'd
To whom?
I mean
Well
A devil.
Why
A joyless
Here is the babe
Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:
The empress sends it thee
'Zounds
Sweet blowse
Villain
That which thou canst not undo.
Thou hast undone our mother.
Villain
And therein
Woe to her chance
Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
It shall not live.
It shall not die.
Aaron
What
Do execution on my flesh and blood.
I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
Nurse
Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
Takes the Child from the Nurse
Stay
Now
That touches this my first-born son and heir!
I tell you
What
Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
Coal-black is better than another hue
For all the water in the ocean
Can never turn the swan's black legs to white
Tell the empress from me
To keep mine own
Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
My mistress is my mistress; this myself
This before all the world do I prefer;
This maugre all the world will I keep safe
By this our mother is forever shamed.
Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
The emperor
I blush to think upon this ignomy.
Why
Fie
The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
Look
He is your brother
Of that self-blood that first gave life to you
He is enfranchised and come to light:
Nay
Aaron
Advise thee
Save thou the child
Then sit we down
My son and I will have the wind of you:
Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.
They sit
How many women saw this child of his?
Why
But say
Cornelia the midwife and myself;
And no one else but the deliver'd empress.
The empress
Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
Go to the empress
He kills the nurse
Weke
What mean'st thou
O Lord
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours
And now be it known to you my full intent.
Not far
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
His child is like to her
Go pack with him
And how by this their child shall be advanced
And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
Hark ye
And you must needs bestow her funeral;
The fields are near
This done
The midwife and the nurse well made away
Aaron
With secrets.
For this care of Tamora
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the Nurse's body
Now to the Goths
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms
Come on
For it is you that puts us to our shifts:
I'll make you feed on berries and on roots
To be a warrior

SCENE III. The same. A public place.
Enter TITUS
Come
Sir boy
Look ye draw home enough
Terras Astraea reliquit:
Be you remember'd
Sirs
Go sound the ocean
Happily you may catch her in the sea;
Yet there's as little justice as at land:
No; Publius and Sempronius
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade
Then
Tell him
Ah
What time I threw the people's suffrages
On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
Go
This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;
And
O Publius
Therefore
By day and night to attend him carefully
Kinsmen
Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude
Publius
What
No
Marry
He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
I'll dive into the burning lake below
Marcus
No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
But metal
And
To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
Come
He gives them the arrows
'Ad Jovem
'Ad Martem
Here
To Saturn
You were as good to shoot against the wind.
To it
Of my word
There's not a god left unsolicited.
Kinsmen
We will afflict the emperor in his pride.
Now
They shoot
O
Good boy
My lord
Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
Ha
Publius
See
This was the sport
That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
And who should find them but the empress' villain?
She laugh'd
But give them to his master for a present.
Why
Enter a Clown

Sirrah
Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?
O
them down again
the next week.
But what says Jupiter
Alas
in all my life.
Why
Ay
Why
From heaven! alas
forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
young days. Why
tribunal plebs
betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.
Why
your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to
the emperor from you.
Tell me
with a grace?
Nay
Sirrah
By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
Hold
Give me pen and ink. Sirrah
deliver a supplication?
Ay
Then here is a supplication for you. And when you
come to him
then look for your reward. I'll be at hand
you do it bravely.
I warrant you
Sirrah
Here
For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.
And when thou hast given it the emperor
God be with you
Come
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The same. Before the palace.
Enter SATURNINUS
Why
An emperor in Rome thus overborne
Of egal justice
My lords
Buz in the people's ears
Of old Andronicus. And what an if
His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits
And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
See
This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
What's this but libelling against the senate
A goodly humour
As who would say
But if I live
Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
But he and his shall know that justice lives
In Saturninus' health
Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
My gracious lord
And rather comfort his distressed plight
Than prosecute the meanest or the best
For these contempts.
Aside
Why
High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
But
Enter Clown
How now
Yea
Empress I am
'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
SATURNINUS reads the letter
Go
How much money must I have?
Come
Hanged! by'r lady
a fair end.
Exit
Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
I know from whence this same device proceeds:
May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons
Go
Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:
For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;
Sly frantic wretch
Enter AEMILIUS
What news with thee
Arm
The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power
high-resolved men
Of Lucius
Who threats
As much as ever Coriolanus did.
Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
These tidings nip me
As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
Ay
'Tis he the common people love so much;
Myself hath often over-heard them say
Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
Ay
King
Is the sun dimm'd
The eagle suffers little birds to sing
He can at pleasure stint their melody:
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
Then cheer thy spirit : for know
With words more sweet
But he will not entreat his son for us.
If Tamora entreat him
For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
With golden promises; that
Almost impregnable
To AEmilius
Go thou before
Say that the emperor requests a parley
Of warlike Lucius
Even at his father's house
AEmilius
And if he stand on hostage for his safety
Your bidding shall I do effectually.
Exit
Now will I to that old Andronicus;
And temper him with all the art I have
And now
Then go successantly
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. Plains near Rome.
Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths
Approved warriors
And how desirous of our sight they are.
Therefore
Brave slip
Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt
Led by their master to the flowered fields
And as he saith
I humbly thank him
But who comes here
Enter a Goth
Renowned Lucius
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
And
Upon the wasted building
I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
'Peace
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white
Peace
the babe
'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
Who
With this
O worthy Goth
That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye
Say
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
Why dost not speak? what
A halter
And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
Too like the sire for ever being good.
First hang the child
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
Get me a ladder.
A ladder brought
Lucius
If thou do this
If thou wilt not
Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
Thy child shall live
An if it please thee! why
For I must talk of murders
Ruthful to hear
And this shall all be buried by my death
Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
Swear that he shall
Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
That granted
What if I do not? as
Yet
And hast a thing within thee called conscience
An idiot holds his bauble for a god
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears
By that same god
Or else I will discover nought to thee.
Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
First know thou
O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
Tut
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
Why
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
O barbarous
Indeed
That codding spirit had they from their mother
That bloody mind
Well
I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
I wrote the letter that thy father found
And hid the gold within the letter mention'd
And what not done
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
When
Beheld his tears
And when I told the empress of this sport
What
Ay
Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
Ay
Even now I curse the day--and yet
Wherein I did not some notorious ill
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night
Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves
And on their skins
Tut
As willingly as one would kill a fly
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
Bring down the devil; for he must not die
So sweet a death as hanging presently.
If there be devils
Sirs
Enter a Goth
My lord
Desires to be admitted to your presence.
Let him come near.
Enter AEMILIUS
Welcome
Lord Lucius
And
What says our general?
AEmilius
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus
Exeunt
SCENE II. Rome. Before TITUS's house.
Enter TAMORA
Thus
To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
Knock at his study
Tell him Revenge is come to join with him
They knock
Enter TITUS
Who doth molest my contemplation?
Is it your trick to make me ope the door
You are deceived: for what I mean to do
See here in bloody lines I have set down;
And what is written shall be executed.
Titus
No
Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.
If thou didst know me
I am not mad; I know thee well enough:
Witness this wretched stump
Witness these trenches made by grief and care
Witness all sorrow
For our proud empress
Is not thy coming for my other hand?
Know
She is thy enemy
I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom
Come down
Confer with me of murder and of death:
There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place
Can couch for fear
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name
Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me
I am; therefore come down
Do me some service
Lo
Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge
And then I'll come and be thy waggoner
Provide thee two proper palfreys
And when thy car is loaden with their heads
Trot
Until his very downfall in the sea:
And day by day I'll do this heavy task
These are my ministers
Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?
Rapine and Murder; therefore called so
Good Lord
And you
Have miserable
O sweet Revenge
And
Exit above
This closing with him fits his lunacy
Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits
And
And
See
Enter TITUS below
Long have I been forlorn
Welcome
Rapine and Murder
How like the empress and her sons you are!
Well are you fitted
Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
For well I wot the empress never wags
But in her company there is a Moor;
And
But welcome
What wouldst thou have us do
Show me a murderer
Show me a villain that hath done a rape
Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong
Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.
Good Murder
Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
To find another that is like to thee
Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
There is a queen
Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion
I pray thee
They have been violent to me and mine.
Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
But would it please thee
When he is here
And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel
What says Andronicus to this device?
Marcus
Enter MARCUS
Go
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
Bid him repair to me
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
Tell him the emperor and the empress too
Feast at my house
This do thou for my love; and so let him
This will I do
Exit
Now will I hence about thy business
Nay
Or else I'll call my brother back again
[Aside to her sons]  What say you
bide with him
How I have govern'd our determined jest?
Yield to his humour
[Aside]  I know them all
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!
Madam
Farewell
To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
I know thou dost; and
Exit TAMORA
Tell us
Tut
Publius
Enter PUBLIUS and others
What is your will?
Know you these two?
The empress' sons
Fie
The one is Murder
And therefore bind them
Caius and Valentine
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour
Exit
PUBLIUS
Villains
And therefore do we what we are commanded.
Stop close their mouths
Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.
Re-enter TITUS
Come
Sirs
But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
O villains
Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud
You kill'd her husband
Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death
Both her sweet hands
Than hands or tongue
What would you say
Villains
Hark
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats
The basin that receives your guilty blood.
You know your mother means to feast with me
Hark
And with your blood and it I'll make a paste
And make two pasties of your shameful heads
This is the feast that I have bid her to
For worse than Philomel you used my daughter
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia
Receive the blood: and when that they are dead
And with this hateful liquor temper it;
And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.
Come
To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
So
Exeunt
SCENE III. Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.
Enter LUCIUS
Uncle Marcus
That I repair to Rome
And ours with thine
Good uncle
Let him receive no sustenance
Till he be brought unto the empress' face
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
I fear the emperor means no good to us.
Some devil whisper curses in mine ear
The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
Away
Sirs
Exeunt Goths
The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.
Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA
What
What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?
Rome's emperor
These quarrels must be quietly debated.
The feast is ready
Hath ordain'd to an honourable end
Please you
Marcus
Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table
Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook
Welcome
Welcome
And welcome
Why art thou thus attired
Because I would be sure to have all well
We are beholding to you
An if your highness knew my heart
My lord the emperor
Was it well done of rash Virginius
To slay his daughter with his own right hand
It was
Your reason
Because the girl should not survive her shame
A reason mighty
A pattern
Die
Kills LAVINIA
And
What hast thou done
Kill'd her
I am as woful as Virginius was
To do this outrage: and it now is done.
What
Will't please you eat? will't please your
highness feed?
Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
They ravish'd her
And they
Go fetch them hither to us presently.
Why
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed
'Tis true
Kills TAMORA
Die
Kills TITUS
Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
There's meed for meed
Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS
You sad-faced men
Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts
This scatter'd corn  into one mutual sheaf
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age
Speak
To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
The story of that baleful burning night
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy
That gives our Troy
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief
When it should move you to attend me most
Here is a captain
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
Then
Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
And they it were that ravished our sister:
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;
Our father's tears despised
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out
Lastly
Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.
And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
I am the turned forth
And from her bosom took the enemy's point
Alas
My scars can witness
But
For when no friends are by
Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant
Of this was Tamora delivered;
The issue of an irreligious Moor
The villain is alive in Titus' house
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
These wrongs
Now you have heard the truth
Have we done aught amiss
Will
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains
Speak
Come
The common voice do cry it shall be so.
Lucius
Go
And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
Exeunt Attendants
LUCIUS
Lucius
Thanks
But
Stand all aloof: but
O
These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face
Tear for tear
O were the sum of these that I should pay
Countless and infinite
Come hither
To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
Many a time he danced thee on his knee
Many a matter hath he told to thee
In that respect
Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
Do him that kindness
O grandsire
Would I were dead
O Lord
My tears will choke me
Re-enter Attendants with AARON
You sad Andronici
Give sentence on this execrable wretch
Set him breast-deep in earth
There let him stand
If any one relieves or pities him
Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
O
I am no baby
I should repent the evils I have done:
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Would I perform
If one good deed in all my life I did
Some loving friends convey the emperor hence
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
Be closed in our household's monument.
As for that heinous tiger
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
Her life was beast-like
And
See justice done on Aaron
Then
Exeunt
ACT I
PROLOGUE
In Troy
The princes orgulous
Of cruel war: sixty and nine
Their crownets regal
Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made
To ransack Troy
The ravish'd Helen
To Tenedos they come;
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
Now expectation
A prologue arm'd
Of author's pen or actor's voice
In like conditions as our argument
Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils
To what may be digested in a play.
Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
Now good or bad
SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.
Enter TROILUS armed
Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
Why should I war without the walls of Troy
Each Trojan that is master of his heart
Will this gear ne'er be mended?
The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
But I am weaker than a woman's tear
And skilless as unpractised infancy.
Well
have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
Have I not tarried?
Ay
the bolting.
Have I not tarried?
Ay
Still have I tarried.
Ay
'hereafter' the kneading
heating of the oven and the baking; nay
stay the cooling too
Patience herself
At Priam's royal table do I sit;
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts
So
Well
her look
I was about to tell thee:--when my heart
But sorrow
An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
well
the women: but
would not
somebody had heard her talk yesterday
will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit
O Pandarus! I tell thee
When I do tell thee
They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
Her eyes
The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me
But
The knife that made it.
I speak no more than truth.
Thou dost not speak so much.
Faith
if she be fair
not
Good Pandarus
I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of
her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
between
What
Because she's kin to me
as Helen: an she were not kin to me
fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.
Say I she is not fair?
I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part
Pandarus
Not I.
Sweet Pandarus
Pray you
found it
Exit PANDARUS. An alarum
Peace
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair
I cannot fight upon this argument;
It is too starved a subject for my sword.
But Pandarus
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
Tell me
Her bed is India; there she lies
Between our Ilium and where she resides
Our doubtful hope
Alarum. Enter AENEAS
How now
Because not there: this woman's answer sorts
What news
That Paris is returned home and hurt.
By whom
Troilus
Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
Alarum
Hark
Better at home
But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
In all swift haste.
Come
Exeunt
SCENE II. The Same. A street.
Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER
Who were those went by?
Queen Hecuba and Helen.
And whither go they?
Up to the eastern tower
Is
He chid Andromache and struck his armourer
Did
In Hector's wrath.
What was his cause of anger?
The noise goes
A lord of Trojan blood
They call him Ajax.
Good; and what of him?
They say he is a very man per se
So do all men
This man
particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion
into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
valour is crushed into folly
discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
hath not a glimpse of
carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
cause
joints of every thing
that he is a gouty Briareus
But how should this man
me smile
They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
struck him down
ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
Who comes here?
Madam
Enter PANDARUS
Hector's a gallant man.
As may be in the world
What's that? what's that?
Good morrow
Good morrow
Good morrow
were you at Ilium?
This morning
What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
up
Hector was gone
Even so: Hector was stirring early.
That were we talking of
Was he angry?
So he says here.
TRUE
about him to-day
Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
heed of Troilus
What
Who
O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
What
man if you see him?
Ay
Well
Then you say as I say; for
No
'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
Himself! Alas
So he is.
Condition
He is not Hector.
Himself! no
himself! Well
or end: well
in her body. No
Excuse me.
He is elder.
Pardon me
Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another
tale
have his wit this year.
He shall not need it
Nor his qualities.
No matter.
Nor his beauty.
'Twould not become him; his own's better.
You have no judgment
herself swore th' other day
a brown favour--for so 'tis
not brown neither
No
'Faith
To say the truth
She praised his complexion above Paris.
Why
So he has.
Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
him above
having colour enough
flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
a copper nose.
I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
Nay
day into the compassed window
has not past three or four hairs on his chin
Indeed
particulars therein to a total.
Why
three pound
Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
Why
becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
O
Does he not?
O yes
Why
loves Troilus
Troilus will stand to the proof
prove it so.
Troilus! why
an addle egg.
If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
head
I cannot choose but laugh
his chin: indeed
must needs confess
Without the rack.
And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
Alas
But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
that her eyes ran o'er.
With mill-stones.
And Cassandra laughed.
But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
And Hector laughed.
At what was all this laughing?
Marry
An't had been a green hair
too.
They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
What was his answer?
Quoth she
chin
This is her question.
That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and
fifty hairs' quoth he
hair is my father
'Jupiter!' quoth she
out
and Helen so blushed
rest so laughed
So let it now; for it has been while going by.
Well
So I do.
I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you
a man born in April.
And I'll spring up in his tears
against May.
A retreat sounded
Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
stand up here
Ilium? good niece
At your pleasure.
Here
see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
Speak not so loud.
AENEAS passes
That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
the flowers of Troy
Troilus; you shall see anon.
ANTENOR passes
Who's that?
That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit
and he's a man good enough
judgments in whosoever
When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
he see me
Will he give you the nod?
You shall see.
If he do
HECTOR passes
That's Hector
fellow! Go thy way
a countenance! is't not a brave man?
O
Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder
you see? look you there: there's no jesting;
there's laying on
there be hacks!
Be those with swords?
Swords! any thing
to him
heart good. Yonder comes Paris
PARIS passes
Look ye yonder
hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why
Helen's heart good now
Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
HELENUS passes
Who's that?
That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
Can Helenus fight
Helenus? no. Yes
marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
TROILUS passes
Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
there's a man
prince of chivalry!
Peace
Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
him
his helm more hacked than Hector's
three and twenty. Go thy way
Had I a sister were a grace
Paris is dirt to him; and
change
Here come more.
Forces pass
Asses
porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look
are gone: crows and daws
rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
all Greece.
There is among the Greeks Achilles
Achilles! a drayman
Well
'Well
you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
birth
Ay
in the pie
You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
lie.
Upon my back
defend my wiles; upon my secrecy
honesty; my mask
defend all these: and at all these wards I lie
thousand watches.
Say one of your watches.
Nay
chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
not have hit
the blow; unless it swell past hiding
past watching.
You are such another!
Enter Troilus's Boy
Sir
Where?
At your own house; there he unarms him.
Good boy
Exit boy
I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well
Adieu
I'll be with you
To bring
Ay
By the same token
Exit PANDARUS
Words
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
Yet hold I off. Women are angels
Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
Achievement is command; ungain'd
Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear
Exeunt
SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.
Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON
Princes
The ample proposition that hope makes
In all designs begun on earth below
Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
Nor
That we come short of our suppose so far
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
Sith every action that hath gone before
Bias and thwart
That gave't surmised shape. Why then
But the protractive trials of great Jove
To find persistive constancy in men:
The fineness of which metal is not found
In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward
But
And what hath mass or matter
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
With due observance of thy godlike seat
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth
Upon her patient breast
With those of nobler bulk!
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
The gentle Thetis
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut
Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled
Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize
Retorts to chiding fortune.
Agamemnon
In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Should be shut up
Besides the applause and approbation To which
most mighty for thy place and sway
And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
I give to both your speeches
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
Should hold up high in brass
As venerable Nestor
On which heaven rides
To his experienced tongue
Speak
That matter needless
Troy
The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
And
Hollow upon this plain
When that the general is not like the hive
To whom the foragers shall all repair
The heavens themselves
Observe degree
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
In evil mixture to disorder wander
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
Commotion in the winds! frights
The unity and married calm of states
Quite from their fixure! O
Take but degree away
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
And make a sop of all this solid globe:
Strength should be lord of imbecility
Force should be right; or rather
Then every thing includes itself in power
And appetite
And this neglection of degree it is
That by a pace goes backward
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
By him one step below
Of his superior
Of pale and bloodless emulation:
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot
Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
The fever whereof all our power is sick.
The nature of the sickness found
The great Achilles
The sinew and the forehand of our host
Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
Breaks scurril jests;
And with ridiculous and awkward action
Lies in his hamstring
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage
Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks
Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
The large Achilles
Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
Now play me Nestor; hem
That's done
Of parallels
Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me
And then
Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit
Sir Valour dies; cries 'O
Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
And in the imitation of these twain--
Who
With an imperial voice--many are infect.
Ajax is grown self-will'd
In such a rein
As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
They tax our policy
But that of hand: the still and mental parts
Of their observant toil the enemies' weight
Why
They call this bed-work
So that the ram that batters down the wall
By reason guide his execution.
Let this be granted
Makes many Thetis' sons.
A tucket
What trumpet? look
From Troy.
Enter AENEAS
What would you 'fore our tent?
Is this great Agamemnon's tent
Even this.
May one
With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
'Fore all the Greekish heads
Call Agamemnon head and general.
Fair leave and large security. How may
A stranger to those most imperial looks
Know them from eyes of other mortals?
How!
Ay;
I ask
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
The youthful Phoebus:
Which is that god in office
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
Are ceremonious courtiers.
Courtiers as free
But when they would seem soldiers
The worthiness of praise distains his worth
But what the repining enemy commends
Sir
Ay
What's your affair I pray you?
Sir
He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear
Speak frankly as the wind;
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
That thou shalt know. Trojan
Trumpet
And every Greek of mettle
Trumpet sounds
We have
A prince call'd Hector
Who in this dull and long-continued truce
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
That holds his honour higher than his ease
In other arms than hers
Hector
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy
If any come
If none
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
This shall be told our lovers
If none of them have soul in such a kind
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove
If then one is
Tell him of Nestor
When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
But if there be not in our Grecian host
One noble man that hath one spark of fire
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn
Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
As may be in the world: his youth in flood
Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
Amen.
Fair Lord AEneas
To our pavilion shall I lead you
Achilles shall have word of this intent;
So shall each lord of Greece
Yourself shall feast with us before you go
And find the welcome of a noble foe.
Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR
Nestor!
What says Ulysses?
I have a young conception in my brain;
Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
What is't?
This 'tis:
Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
That hath to this maturity blown up
In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd
Well
This challenge that the gallant Hector sends
The purpose is perspicuous even as substance
And
As banks of Libya
Pointing on him.
And wake him to the answer
Yes
For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
With their finest palate: and trust to me
In this wild action; for the success
Of good or bad unto the general;
And in such indexes
To their subsequent volumes
The baby figure of the giant mass
Of things to come at large. It is supposed
He that meets Hector issues from our choice
And choice
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying
Which entertain'd
Directive by the limbs.
Give pardon to my speech:
Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
Let us
That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
For both our honour and our shame in this
Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
What glory our Achilles shares from Hector
But he already is too insolent;
A nd we were better parch in Afric sun
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
In taint of our best man. No
And
The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
Give him allowance for the better man;
For that will physic the great Myrmidon
Who broils in loud applause
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off
That we have better men. But
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
Ulysses
And I will give a taste of it forthwith
To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
Must tarre the mastiffs on

ACT II
SCENE I. A part of the Grecian camp.
Enter AJAX and THERSITES
Thersites!
Agamemnon
Thersites!
And those boils did run? say so: did not the
general run then? were not that a botchy core?
Dog!
Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.
Thou bitch-wolf's son
Beating him
Feel
The plague of Greece upon thee
beef-witted lord!
Speak then
beat thee into handsomeness.
I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but
thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike
Toadstool
Dost thou think I have no sense
The proclamation!
Thou art proclaimed a fool
Do not
I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
the scratching of thee; I would make thee the
loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in
the incursions
I say
Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles
Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty
barkest at him.
Mistress Thersites!
Thou shouldest strike him.
Cobloaf!
He would pun thee into shivers with his fist
sailor breaks a biscuit.
[Beating him]  You whoreson cur!
Do
Thou stool for a witch!
Ay
more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego
may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art
here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and
sold among those of any wit
If thou use to beat me
tell what thou art by inches
bowels
You dog!
You scurvy lord!
[Beating him]  You cur!
Mars his idiot! do
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Why
You see him there
Ay; what's the matter?
Nay
So I do: what's the matter?
Nay
'Well!' why
But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you
take him to be
I know that
Ay
Therefore I beat thee.
Lo
evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his
brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy
nine sparrows for a penny
worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord
his guts in his head
him.
What?
I say
Ajax offers to beat him
Nay
Has not so much wit--
Nay
As will stop the eye of Helen's needle
comes to fight.
Peace
I would have peace and quietness
not: he there: that he: look you there.
O thou damned cur! I shall--
Will you set your wit to a fool's?
No
Good words
What's the quarrel?
I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
proclamation
I serve thee not.
Well
I serve here voluntarily.
Your last service was sufferance
voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
here the voluntary
E'en so; a great deal of your wit
sinews
catch
were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
What
There's Ulysses and old Nestor
ere your grandsires had nails on their toes
like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.
What
Yes
I shall cut out your tongue.
'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou
afterwards.
No more words
I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me
There's for you
I will see you hanged
any more to your tents: I will keep where there is
wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
Exit
A good riddance.
Marry
That Hector
To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
Farewell. Who shall answer him?
I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise
He knew his man.

Exeunt
SCENE II. Troy. A room in Priam's palace.
Enter PRIAM
After so many hours
'Deliver Helen
As honour
In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
Shall be struck off.' Hector
Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
As far as toucheth my particular
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety
The beacon of the wise
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
Since the first sword was drawn about this question
If we have lost so many tenths of ours
The yielding of her up?
Fie
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
So great as our dread father in a scale
Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
The past proportion of his infinite?
And buckle in a waist most fathomless
With spans and inches so diminutive
As fears and reasons? fie
No marvel
Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
You are for dreams and slumbers
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
your reasons:
You know an enemy intends you harm;
You know a sword employ'd is perilous
Who marvels then
A Grecian and his sword
The very wings of reason to his heels
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove
Should have hare-hearts
their thoughts
With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
Brother
The holding.
What is aught
But value dwells not in particular will;
It holds his estimate and dignity
As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
To make the service greater than the god
And the will dotes that is attributive
To what infectiously itself affects
I take to-day a wife
Is led on in the conduct of my will;
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
Of will and judgment: how may I avoid
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant
We do not throw in unrespective sieve
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
The seas and winds
And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired
Wrinkles Apollo's
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
Is she worth keeping? why
If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
As you must needs
If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
As you must needs
And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate
Richer than sea and land? O

[Within]  Cry
It is Cassandra.

Our firebrand brother
Cry

Exit
Now
Of divination in our sister work
Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
So madly hot that no discourse of reason
Why
Such and no other than event doth form it
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
Which hath our several honours all engaged
To make it gracious. For my private part
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
To fight for and maintain!
Else might the world convince of levity
As well my undertakings as your counsels:
But I attest the gods
Gave wings to my propension and cut off
All fears attending on so dire a project.
For what
What Propugnation is in one man's valour
This quarrel would excite? Yet
And had as ample power as I have will
Paris
Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
You have the honey still
So to be valiant is no praise at all.
Sir
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Wiped off
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen
On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
That so degenerate a strain as this
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
There's not the meanest spirit on our party
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
When Helen is defended
Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
Where Helen is the subject; then
Paris and Troilus
Have glozed
Unlike young men
Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
The reasons you allege do more conduce
To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
Than to make up a free determination
'Twixt right and wrong
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Of any true decision. Nature craves
All dues be render'd to their owners: now
Than wife is to the husband? If this law
Of nature be corrupted through affection
To their benumbed wills
To curb those raging appetites that are
Most disobedient and refractory.
If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king
Of nature and of nations speak aloud
To have her back return'd: thus to persist
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong
Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless
In resolution to keep Helen still
Upon our joint and several dignities.
Why
Were it not glory that we more affected
Than the performance of our heaving spleens
Spent more in her defence. But
For
So rich advantage of a promised glory
As smiles upon the forehead of this action
For the wide world's revenue.
I am yours
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
I was advertised their great general slept

SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
Enter THERSITES
How now
thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
beats me
would it were otherwise; that I could beat him
conjure and raise devils
my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles
rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
undermine it
themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus
caduceus
than little wit from them that they have! which
short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
scarce
from a spider
cutting the web. After this
whole camp! or rather
for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
Enter PATROCLUS
Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites
If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit
wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common
curse of mankind
great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor
discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
out says thou art a fair corse
sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
Amen. Where's Achilles?
What
Ay: the heavens hear me!
Enter ACHILLES
Who's there?
Thersites
Where
digestion
my table so many meals? Come
Thy commander
Thy lord
Thy knower
Thou mayst tell that knowest.
O
I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'
knower
You rascal!
Peace
He is a privileged man. Proceed
Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites
is a fool
Derive this; come.
Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;
Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool
Patroclus is a fool positive.
Why am I a fool?
Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
art. Look you
Patroclus
Come in with me
Exit
Here is such patchery
knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a
whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
and bleed to death upon. Now
the subject! and war and lechery confound all!
Exit
Enter AGAMEMNON
Where is Achilles?
Within his tent; but ill disposed
Let it be known to him that we are here.
He shent our messengers; and we lay by
Our appertainments
Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
We dare not move the question of our place
I shall say so to him.
Exit
We saw him at the opening of his tent:
He is not sick.
Yes
melancholy
head
cause. A word
Takes AGAMEMNON aside
What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
Who
He.
Then will Ajax lack matter
No
argument
All the better; their fraction is more our wish than
their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
could disunite.
The amity that wisdom knits not
untie. Here comes Patroclus.
Re-enter PATROCLUS
No Achilles with him.
The elephant hath joints
his legs are legs for necessity
Achilles bids me say
Did move your greatness and this noble state
To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
But for your health and your digestion sake
Hear you
We are too well acquainted with these answers:
But his evasion
Much attribute he hath
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues
And under-honest
Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
than himself
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
His humorous predominance; yea
His pettish lunes
The passage and whole carriage of this action
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this
Not portable
'Bring action hither
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
I shall; and bring his answer presently.
Exit
In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
We come to speak with him. Ulysses
Exit ULYSSES
What is he more than another?
No more than what he thinks he is.
Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
better man than I am?
No question.
Will you subscribe his thought
No
wise
more tractable.
Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
know not what pride is.
Your mind is the clearer
fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
his own glass
and whatever praises itself but in the deed
the deed in the praise.
I do hate a proud man
Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
Aside
Re-enter ULYSSES
Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
What's his excuse?
He doth rely on none
Without observance or respect of any
Why will he not upon our fair request
Untent his person and share the air with us?
Things small as nothing
That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
And batters down himself: what should I say?
He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
Cry 'No recovery.'
Let Ajax go to him.
Dear lord
'Tis said he holds you well
At your request a little from himself.
O Agamemnon
We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
And never suffers matter of the world
Enter his thoughts
And ruminate himself
Of that we hold an idol more than he?
No
Must not so stale his palm
Nor
That were to enlard his fat already pride
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
With entertaining great Hyperion.
This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid
[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O
vein of him.
[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks up
this applause!
If I go to him
O
An a' be proud with me
Let me go to him.
Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
A paltry
How he describes himself!
Can he not be sociable?
The raven chides blackness.
I'll let his humours blood.
He will be the physician that should be the patient.
An all men were o' my mind
Wit would be out of fashion.
A' should not bear it so
shall pride carry it?
An 'twould
A' would have ten shares.
I will knead him; I'll make him supple.
He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
pour in
[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord
Our noble general
You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
Why
Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
I will be silent.
Wherefore should you so?
He is not emulous
Know the whole world
A whoreson dog
Would he were a Trojan!
What a vice were it in Ajax now
If he were proud
Or covetous of praise
Ay
Or strange
Thank the heavens
Praise him that got thee
Famed be thy tutor
Thrice famed
But he that disciplined thy arms to fight
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom
Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;
Instructed by the antiquary times
Put pardon
As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd
Shall I call you father?
Ay
Be ruled by him
There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
To call together all his state of war;
Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
We must with all our main of power stand fast:
And here's a lord
Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:

Staying for waftage. O

I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
The imaginary relish is so sweet
That it enchants my sense: what will it be
Love's thrice repured nectar? death
I fear it much; and I do fear besides
As doth a battle

O Cressida

What should they grant? what makes this pretty
abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
lady in the fountain of our love?
More dregs than water
Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
Blind fear
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
fear the worst oft cures the worse.
O
pageant there is presented no monster.
Nor nothing monstrous neither?
Nothing
seas
it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
This is the monstruosity in love
is infinite and the execution confined
desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
They say all lovers swear more performance than they
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
perform
discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
that have the voice of lions and the act of hares
Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
are tasted
bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
shall have a praise in present: we will not name
desert before his birth
shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
shall be a mock for his truth
speak truest not truer than Troilus.

For many weary months.
Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
Hard to seem won: but I was won
If I confess much
I love you now; but not
But I might master it: in faith
My thoughts were like unbridled children
Too headstrong for their mother. See
Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us
But
And yet
Of speaking first. Sweet
The thing I shall repent. See
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.

I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
For this time will I take my leave
Your leave
Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning
Pray you
What offends you
Sir
You cannot shun Yourself.
Let me go and try:
I have a kind of self resides with you;
But an unkind self
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
Perchance
And fell so roundly to a large confession
Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
O that I thought it could be in a woman--
As
To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;
To keep her constancy in plight and youth
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me
Might be affronted with the match and weight
Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
How were I then uplifted! but
I am as true as truth's simplicity
And simpler than the infancy of truth.
In that I'll war with you.
O virtuous fight
True swains in love shall in the world to come
Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes
Prophet may you be!
If I be false
To dusty nothing
As air

witness. Here I hold your hand
If ever you prove false one to another
taken such pains to bring you together
pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end
after my name; call them all Pandars; let all
constant men be Troiluses
Amen.
Amen.
Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
bed; which bed
pretty encounters
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
Bed
Exeunt
SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
Enter AGAMEMNON
Now
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
That
That time
Made tame and most familiar to my nature
As new into the world
I do beseech you
What wouldst thou of us
You have a Trojan prisoner
Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange
That their negotiations all must slack
Give us a prince of blood
Shall quite strike off all service I have done
Let Diomedes bear him
What he requests of us. Good Diomed
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
Which I am proud to bear.
Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
Please it our general to pass strangely by him
I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
If so
It may be good: pride hath no other glass
To show itself but pride
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
We'll execute your purpose
A form of strangeness as we pass along:
So do each lord
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
What
You know my mind
What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
Would you
No.
Nothing
The better.
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR
Good day
How do you? how do you?
Exit
What
How now
Good morrow
Ha?
Good morrow.
Ay
Exit
What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
To come as humbly as they used to creep
To holy altars.
What
'Tis certain
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
As feel in his own fall; for men
That are without him
Which when they fall
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
At ample point all that I did possess
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
I'll interrupt his reading.
How now Ulysses!
Now
What are you reading?
A strange fellow here
Writes me: 'That man
As when his virtues shining upon others
Heat them and they retort that heat again
To the first giver.'
This is not strange
The beauty that is borne here in the face
The bearer knows not
To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself
Salutes each other with each other's form;
For speculation turns not to itself
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
I do not strain at the position
It is familiar
Who
That no man is the lord of any thing
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
Till he behold them form'd in the applause
Where they're extended; who
The voice again
Fronting the sun
His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;
And apprehended here immediately
The unknown Ajax.
Heavens
Most abject in regard and dear in use!
What things again most dear in the esteem
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
Ajax renown'd. O heavens
How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall
How one man eats into another's pride
To see these Grecian lords!--why
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder
And great Troy shrieking.
I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
As misers do by beggars
Good word nor look: what
Time hath
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
As fast as they are made
As done: perseverance
Quite out of fashion
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
For honour travels in a strait so narrow
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue: if you give way
And leave you hindmost;
Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank
For time is like a fashionable host
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand
virtue seek
Remuneration for the thing it was;
For beauty
To envious and calumniating time.
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
The present eye praises the present object.
Then marvel not
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee
And case thy reputation in thy tent;
Whose glorious deeds
And drave great Mars to faction.
Of this my privacy
I have strong reasons.
But 'gainst your privacy
The reasons are more potent and heroical:
'Tis known
With one of Priam's daughters.
Ha! known!
Is that a wonder?
The providence that's in a watchful state
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold
There is a mystery--with whom relation
Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
Which hath an operation more divine
Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
As perfectly is ours as yours
And better would it fit Achilles much
To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home
Farewell
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
Exit
To this effect
A woman impudent and mannish grown
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
They think my little stomach to the war
And your great love to me restrains you thus:
Sweet
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
Ay
I see my reputation is at stake
My fame is shrewdly gored.
O
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
Omission to do what is necessary
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
And danger
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
Go call Thersites hither
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing
Enter THERSITES
A labour saved!
A wonder!
What?
Ajax goes up and down the field
How so?
He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
raves in saying nothing.
How can that be?
Why
and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
bites his lip with a politic regard
say 'There were wit in this head
and so there is
in a flint
The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
neck i' the combat
vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow
you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
grown a very land-fish
A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
sides
Thou must be my ambassador to him
Who
answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
Patroclus make demands to me
pageant of Ajax.
To him
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
to come unarmed to my tent
safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
captain-general of the Grecian army
Jove bless great Ajax!
Hum!
I come from the worthy Achilles
Ha!
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent
Hum!
And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
Agamemnon!
Ay
Ha!
What say you to't?
God b' wi' you
Your answer
If to-morrow be a fair day
go one way or other: howsoever
ere he has me.
Your answer
Fare you well
Why
No
him when Hector has knocked out his brains
not; but
get his sinews to make catlings on.
Come
Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more
capable creature.
My mind is troubled
And I myself see not the bottom of it.
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
Would the fountain of your mind were clear again
tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
Exit
ACT IV
SCENE I. Troy. A street.
Enter
See
It is the Lord AEneas.
Is the prince there in person?
Had I so good occasion to lie long
As you
Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
That's my mind too. Good morrow
A valiant Greek
Witness the process of your speech
You told how Diomed
Health to you
But when I meet you arm'd
As heart can think or courage execute.
The one and other Diomed embraces.
Our bloods are now in calm; and
But when contention and occasion meet
With all my force
And thou shalt hunt a lion
With his face backward. In humane gentleness
The thing he means to kill more excellently.
We sympathize: Jove
But
We know each other well.
We do; and long to know each other worse.
This is the most despiteful gentle greeting
What business
I was sent for to the king; but why
His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
To Calchas' house
Let's have your company
Or rather
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
We shall be much unwelcome.
That I assure you:
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Than Cressid borne from Troy.
There is no help;
The bitter disposition of the time
Will have it so. On
Good morrow
Exit with Servant
And tell me
Both alike:
He merits well to have her
He
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
You
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
Both merits poised
But he as he
You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
She's bitter to her country: hear me
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
Of her contaminated carrion weight
As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
Fair Diomed
But we in silence hold this virtue well
Here lies our way.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The same. Court of Pandarus' house.
Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA
Dear
Then
He shall unbolt the gates.
Trouble him not;
To bed
As infants' empty of all thought!
Good morrow
I prithee now
Are you a-weary of me?
O Cressida! but that the busy day
Night hath been too brief.
Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
As tediously as hell
With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
You will catch cold
Prithee
You men will never tarry.
O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off
there's one up.
[Within]  What
It is your uncle.
A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
I shall have such a life!
Enter PANDARUS
How now
maid! where's my cousin Cressid?
Go hang yourself
You bring me to do
To do what? to do what? let her say
what: what have I brought you to do?
Come
Ha! ha! Alas
hast not slept to-night? would he not
man
Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
Knocking within
Who's that at door? good uncle
My lord
You smile and mock me
Ha
Come
Knocking within
How earnestly they knock! Pray you
I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA
Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
down the door? How now! what's the matter?
Enter AENEAS
Good morrow
Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth
Is not Prince Troilus here?
Here! what should he do here?
Come
It doth import him much to speak with me.
Is he here
be sworn: for my own part
should he do here?
Who!--nay
ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him
false to him: do not you know of him
fetch him hither; go.
Re-enter TROILUS
How now! what's the matter?
My lord
Paris your brother
Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith
The Lady Cressida.
Is it so concluded?
By Priam and the general state of Troy:
They are at hand and ready to effect it.
How my achievements mock me!
I will go meet them: and
Good
Have not more gift in taciturnity.
Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS
Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!
Re-enter CRESSIDA
How now! what's the matter? who was here?
Ah
Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
Tell me
Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
O the gods! what's the matter?
Prithee
born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O
gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
Good uncle
Thou must be gone
art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father
'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.
O you immortal gods! I will not go.
Thou must.
I will not
I know no touch of consanguinity;
No kin no love
As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood
But the strong base and building of my love
Is as the very centre of the earth
Do
Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks
With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
Exeunt
SCENE III. The same. Street before Pandarus' house.
Enter PARIS
It is great morning
Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus
Walk into her house;
I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
And to his hand when I deliver her
A priest there offering to it his own heart.
Exit
I know what 'tis to love;
And would
Please you walk in
Exeunt
SCENE IV. The same. Pandarus' house.
Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA
Be moderate
Why tell you me of moderation?
The grief is fine
As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
If I could temporize with my affection
My love admits no qualifying dross;
No more my grief
Here
Enter TROILUS
Ah
O Troilus! Troilus!
Embracing him
What a pair of spectacles is here!
Let me embrace too. 'O heart
where he answers again
By friendship nor by speaking.'
There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
nothing
verse: we see it
Cressid
Cold lips blow to their deities
Have the gods envy?
Ay
And is it true that I must go from Troy?
A hateful truth.
What
From Troy and Troilus.
Is it possible?
And suddenly; where injury of chance
Puts back leave-taking
All time of pause
Of all rejoindure
Our lock'd embrasures
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
We two
Did buy each other
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
Injurious time now with a robber's haste
Crams his rich thievery up
As many farewells as be stars in heaven
[Within]  My lord
Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.
Where are my tears? rain
my heart will be blown up by the root.
Exit
I must then to the Grecians?
No remedy.
A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
When shall we see again?
Hear me
I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
Nay
I speak not 'be thou true
But 'be thou true
My sequent protestation; be thou true
O
As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
And you this glove. When shall I see you?
I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels
But yet be true.
O heavens! 'be true' again!
Hear while I speak it
The Grecian youths are full of quality;
They're loving
How novelty may move
Which
Makes me afeard.
O heavens! you love me not.
Die I a villain
In this I do not call your faith in question
So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing
But I can tell that in each grace of these
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
Do you think I will?
No.
But something may be done that we will not:
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves
[Within]  Nay
Come
[Within]  Brother Troilus!
Good brother
And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
My lord
Who
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns
Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.
Enter AENEAS
Welcome
Which for Antenor we deliver you:
At the port
Entreat her fair; and
As Priam is in Ilion.
Fair Lady Cressid
The lustre in your eye
You shall be mistress
Grecian
In praising her: I tell thee
As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
I charge thee use her well
For
O
Let me be privileged by my place and message
I'll answer to my lust: and know you
She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so
I'll speak it in my spirit and honour
Come
Lady
Exeunt TROILUS
Trumpet within
Hark! Hector's trumpet.
How have we spent this morning!
The prince must think me tardy and remiss
'Tis Troilus' fault: come
Let us make ready straight.
Yea
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
On his fair worth and single chivalry.
Exeunt
SCENE V. The Grecian camp. Lists set out.
Enter AJAX
Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy
May pierce the head of the great combatant
And hale him hither.
Thou
Now crack thy lungs
Blow
Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
Come
Thou blow'st for Hector.
Trumpet sounds
No trumpet answers.
'Tis but early days.
Is not yond Diomed
'Tis he
He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
Enter DIOMEDES
Is this the Lady Cressid?
Even she.
Most dearly welcome to the Greeks
Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
Yet is the kindness but particular;
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
So much for Nestor.
I'll take what winter from your lips
Achilles bids you welcome.
I had good argument for kissing once.
But that's no argument for kissing now;
For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment
O deadly gall
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
The first was Menelaus' kiss; this
Patroclus kisses you.
O
Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
I'll have my kiss
In kissing
Both take and give.
I'll make my match to live
Therefore no kiss.
I'll give you boot
You're an odd man; give even or give none.
An odd man
No
You fillip me o' the head.
No
It were no match
May I
You may.
I do desire it.
Why
Why then for Venus' sake
I am your debtor
Never's my day
Lady
Exit with CRESSIDA
A woman of quick sense.
Fie
There's language in her eye
At every joint and motive of her body.
O
To every ticklish reader! set them down
For sluttish spoils of opportunity
And daughters of the game.
Trumpet within
The Trojans' trumpet.
Yonder comes the troop.
Enter HECTOR
Hail
To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
A victor shall be known? will you the knights
Shall to the edge of all extremity
Pursue each other
By any voice or order of the field?
Hector bade ask.
Which way would Hector have it?
He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
'Tis done like Hector; but securely done
The knight opposed.
If not Achilles
If not Achilles
Therefore Achilles: but
In the extremity of great and little
The one almost as infinite as all
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
In love whereof
Half heart
This blended knight
A maiden battle
Re-enter DIOMEDES
Here is Sir Diomed. Go
Consent upon the order of their fight
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists
They are opposed already.
What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
The youngest son of Priam
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
His heart and hand both open and both free;
For what he has he gives
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
Manly as Hector
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
To tender objects
Is more vindicative than jealous love:
They call him Troilus
A second hope
Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
Even to his inches
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight
They are in action.
Now
Hector
Awake thee!
His blows are well disposed: there
You must no more.
Trumpets cease
Princes
I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
As Hector pleases.
Why
Thou art
The obligation of our blood forbids
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all
All Greek
Runs on the dexter cheek
Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent
Wherein my sword had not impressure made
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother
Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee
By him that thunders
Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
Cousin
I thank thee
Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
I came to kill thee
A great addition earned in thy death.
Not Neoptolemus so mirable
Cries 'This is he
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
There is expectance here from both the sides
We'll answer it;
The issue is embracement: Ajax
If I might in entreaties find success--
As seld I have the chance--I would desire
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
'Tis Agamemnon's wish
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
AEneas
To the expecters of our Trojan part;
Desire them home. Give me thy hand
I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
But for Achilles
Shall find him by his large and portly size.
Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy;
But that's no welcome: understand more clear
And formless ruin of oblivion;
But in this extant moment
I thank thee
[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy
less to you.
Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
You brace of warlike brothers
Who must we answer?
The noble Menelaus.
O
Mock not
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
She's well
Name her not now
O
I have
Labouring for destiny make cruel way
Through ranks of Greekish youth
'Lo
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath
But this thy countenance
But
And
'Tis the old Nestor.
Let me embrace thee
Most reverend Nestor
I would my arms could match thee in contention
I would they could.
Ha!
By this white beard
Well
I wonder now how yonder city stands
When we have here her base and pillar by us.
I know your favour
Ah
In Ilion
Sir
My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
For yonder walls
I must not believe you:
There they stand yet
A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all
So to him we leave it.
Most gentle and most valiant Hector
After the general
To feast with me and see me at my tent.
I shall forestall thee
Now
I have with exact view perused thee
Is this Achilles?
I am Achilles.
Stand fair
Behold thy fill.
Nay
Thou art too brief: I will the second time
O
But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
Tell me
Shall I destroy him? whether there
That I may give the local wound a name
And make distinct the very breach whereout
Hector's great spirit flew: answer me
It would discredit the blest gods
Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
As to prenominate in nice conjecture
Where thou wilt hit me dead?
I tell thee
Wert thou an oracle to tell me so
For I'll not kill thee there
But
You wisest Grecians
His insolence draws folly from my lips;
But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words
Do not chafe thee
And you
You may have every day enough of Hector
If you have stomach; the general state
I pray you
We have had pelting wars
The Grecians' cause.
Dost thou entreat me
To-morrow do I meet thee
To-night all friends.
Thy hand upon that match.
First
There in the full convive we: afterwards
Concur together
Beat loud the tabourines
Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES
My Lord Ulysses
At Menelaus' tent
There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;
Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth
On the fair Cressid.
Shall sweet lord
You shall command me
As gentle tell me
This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
That wails her absence?
O
A mock is due. Will you walk on
She was beloved
But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.
Exeunt
ACT V
SCENE I. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night
Patroclus
Here comes Thersites.
Enter THERSITES
How now
Thou crusty batch of nature
Why
of idiot worshippers
From whence
Why
Who keeps the tent now?
The surgeon's box
Well said
Prithee
thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.
Male varlet
Why
of the south
palsies
lungs
rivelled fee-simple of the tetter
again such preposterous discoveries!
Why thou damnable box of envy
thou to curse thus?
Do I curse thee?
Why no
indistinguishable cur
No! why art thou then exasperate
immaterial skein of sleave-silk
flap for a sore eye
purse
with such waterflies
Out
Finch-egg!
My sweet Patroclus
From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
My major vow lies here
Come
This night in banqueting must all be spent.
Away
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
With too much blood and too little brain
may run mad; but
little blood they do
Here's Agamemnon
that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as
earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
there
shoeing-horn in a chain
leg
with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
To an ass
an ox
dog
owl
not care; but to be Menelaus
against destiny. Ask me not
were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse
of a lazar
spirits and fires!
Enter HECTOR
We go wrong
No
There
I trouble you.
No
Here comes himself to guide you.
Re-enter ACHILLES
Welcome
So now
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.
Good night
Good night
Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink
Good night and welcome
That go or tarry.
Good night.
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS
Old Nestor tarries; and you too
I cannot
Give me your hand.
[Aside to TROILUS]  Follow his torch; he goes to
Calchas' tent:
I'll keep you company.
Sweet sir
And so
Exit DIOMEDES; ULYSSES and TROILUS following
Come
Exeunt ACHILLES
That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue
unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers
than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
his mouth
but when he performs
is prodigious
borrows of the moon
word. I will rather leave to see Hector
not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
drab
after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
Exit
SCENE II. The same. Before Calchas' tent.
Enter DIOMEDES
What
[Within]  Who calls?
Calchas
[Within]  She comes to you.
Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES
Stand where the torch may not discover us.
Enter CRESSIDA
Cressid comes forth to him.
How now
Now
Whispers
Yea
She will sing any man at first sight.
And any man may sing her
she's noted.
Will you remember?
Remember! yes.
Nay
And let your mind be coupled with your words.
What should she remember?
List.
Sweet honey Greek
Roguery!
Nay
I'll tell you what
Foh
In faith
A juggling trick
What did you swear you would bestow on me?
I prithee
Bid me do any thing but that
Good night.
Hold
How now
Diomed
No
Thy better must.
Hark
O plague and madness!
You are moved
To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
The time right deadly; I beseech you
Behold
Nay
You flow to great distraction; come
I pray thee
You have not patience; come.
I pray you
I will not speak a word!
And so
Nay
Doth that grieve thee?
O wither'd truth!
Why
By Jove
Guardian!--why
Foh
In faith
You shake
You will break out.
She strokes his cheek!
Come
Nay
There is between my will and all offences
A guard of patience: stay a little while.
How the devil Luxury
potato-finger
But will you
In faith
Give me some token for the surety of it.
I'll fetch you one.
Exit
You have sworn patience.
Fear me not
I will not be myself
Of what I feel: I am all patience.
Re-enter CRESSIDA
Now the pledge; now
Here
O beauty! where is thy faith?
My lord
I will be patient; outwardly I will.
You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.
Whose was't?
It is no matter
I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
I prithee
Now she sharpens: well said
I shall have it.
What
Ay
O
Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
Of thee and me
He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
I had your heart before
I did swear patience.
You shall not have it
I'll give you something else.
I will have this: whose was it?
It is no matter.
Come
'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
But
Whose was it?
By all Diana's waiting-women yond
To-morrow will I wear it on my helm
Wert thou the devil
Well
I will not keep my word.
Why
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
You shall not go: one cannot speak a word
I do not like this fooling.
Nor I
What
Ay
Farewell till then.
Good night: I prithee
Exit DIOMEDES

But with my heart the other eye doth see.
Ah
What error leads must err; O
Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
Exit
A proof of strength she could not publish more
All's done
It is.
Why stay we
To make a recordation to my soul
Of every syllable that here was spoke.
But if I tell how these two did co-act
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart
Was Cressid here?
I cannot conjure
She was not
Most sure she was.
Why
Nor mine
Let it not be believed for womanhood!
Think
To stubborn critics
By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
What hath she done
Nothing at all
Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
This she? no
If beauty have a soul
If souls guide vows
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
Without perdition
Without revolt: this is
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
Divides more wider than the sky and earth
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
Instance
Cressid is mine
Instance
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd
And with another knot
Of her o'er-eaten faith
May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
With that which here his passion doth express?
Ay
In characters as red as Mars his heart
Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
Hark
That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill
Which shipmen do the hurricano call
In his descent than shall my prompted sword
Falling on Diomed.
He'll tickle it for his concupy.
O Cressid! O false Cressid! false
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name
O
Your passion draws ears hither.
Enter AENEAS
I have been seeking you this hour
Hector
Ajax
Have with you
Farewell
I'll bring you to the gates.
Accept distracted thanks.
Exeunt TROILUS
Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
croak like a raven; I would bode
Patroclus will give me any thing for the
intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
Lechery
else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!

Enter CASSANDRA
Where is my brother Hector?
Here
Consort with me in loud and dear petition
Of bloody turbulence
Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
O
Ho! bid my trumpet sound!
No notes of sally
Be gone
The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
They are polluted offerings
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
O
To hurt by being just: it is as lawful
It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
But vows to every purpose must not hold:
Unarm
Hold you still
Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
Lie every man holds dear; but the brave man
Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
Enter TROILUS
How now
Cassandra
Exit CASSANDRA
No
I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong

What vice is that
When many times the captive Grecian falls
O
Fool's play
How now! how now!
For the love of all the gods
Fie

Who should withhold me?

Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees
Not you
Re-enter CASSANDRA
Lay hold upon him
He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay
Come
Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
To tell thee that this day is ominous:
Therefore
AEneas is a-field;
And I do stand engaged to many Greeks
This morning to them.
Ay
I must not break my faith.
You know me dutiful; therefore
To take that course by your consent and voice
O Priam

Upon the love you bear me
Exit ANDROMACHE

Makes all these bodements.
O
Look

Hark
How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
Behold
Away! away!
Farewell: yet
Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.

You are amazed
Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight
Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!

Do you hear
What now?
Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
Let me read.
A whoreson tisick
troubles me
and what one thing
leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum
in mine eyes too

Words
The effect doth operate another way.
Tearing the letter

My love with words and errors still she feeds;
But edifies another with her deeds.
Exeunt severally

Alarums: excursions. Enter THERSITES

them meet; that that same young Trojan ass
loves the whore there
whore-masterly villain
dissembling luxurious drab
O' the t'other side

policy
as bad a kind
prouder than the cur Achilles

barbarism

Enter HECTOR
What art thou
Art thou of blood and honour?
No
a very filthy rogue.
I do believe thee: live.

miracle: yet

Even with the vail and darking of the sun
I am unarm'd; forego this vantage

HECTOR falls
So
Here lies thy heart
On
A retreat sounded
Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.

He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail
Frown on
Sit
I say
My lord
You understand me not that tell me so:
I do not speak of flight
Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
Who shall tell Priam so
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd
There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives
Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents
I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still
Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans

But hear you
Hence
Pursue thy life

Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing
And being once subdued in armed tail

Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade
It should be now
Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases

Enter DUKE ORSINO
If music be the food of love
Give me excess of it
That strain again! it had a dying fall:
O
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou
Receiveth as the sea
That it alone is high fantastical.
Will you go hunt
What
The hart.
Why
O
That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
And my desires
Enter VALENTINE
How now! what news from her?
So please my lord
But from her handmaid do return this answer:
The element itself
But
And water once a day her chamber round
With eye-offending brine: all this to season
A brother's dead love
And lasting in her sad remembrance.
O
To pay this debt of love but to a brother
Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
That live in her; when liver
Her sweet perfections with one self king!
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.
Exeunt
SCENE II. The sea-coast.
Enter VIOLA
What country
This is Illyria
And what should I do in Illyria?
My brother he is in Elysium.
Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
TRUE
Hung on our driving boat
Where
So long as I could see.
For saying so
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope
Ay
Not three hours' travel from this very place.
Who governs here?
A noble duke
What is the name?
Orsino.
Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
He was a bachelor then.
And so is now
For but a month ago I went from hence
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
What's she?
A virtuous maid
That died some twelvemonth since
In the protection of his son
And sight of men.
O that I served that lady
And might not be delivered to the world
That were hard to compass;
Because she will admit no kind of suit
There is a fair behavior in thee
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
Doth oft close in pollution
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
With this thy fair and outward character.
I prithee
For such disguise as haply shall become
The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
And speak to him in many sorts of music
That will allow me very worth his service.
What else may hap to time I will commit;
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
Be you his eunuch
When my tongue blabs
I thank thee: lead me on.

SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.

What a plague means my niece
her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
By my troth
nights: your cousin
exceptions to your ill hours.
Why
Ay
limits of order.
Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
these boots too: an they be not
themselves in their own straps.
That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
Who
Ay
He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
What's that to the purpose?
Why
Ay
he's a very fool and a prodigal.
Fie
viol-de-gamboys
word for word without book
gifts of nature.
He hath indeed
he's a fool
he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
hath in quarrelling
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
By this hand
that say so of him. Who are they?
They that add
With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
o' the toe like a parish-top. What
Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
Enter SIR ANDREW
Sir Toby Belch! how now
Sweet Sir Andrew!
Bless you
And you too
Accost
What's that?
My niece's chambermaid.
Good Mistress Accost
My name is Mary
Good Mistress Mary Accost
You mistake

By my troth

Fare you well
An thou let part so
never draw sword again.
An you part so
draw sword again. Fair lady
fools in hand?
Sir
Marry
Now
your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
Wherefore
It's dry
Why
keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
A dry jest
Are you full of them?
Ay
Exit
O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
see thee so put down?
Never in your life
put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
No question.
An I thought that
to-morrow
Pourquoi
What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
fencing
followed the arts!
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
Why
Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
But it becomes me well enough
Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
and spin it off.
Faith
will not be seen; or if she be
she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
her degree
have heard her swear't. Tut
I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
and revels sometimes altogether.
Art thou good at these kickshawses
As any man in Illyria
degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
with an old man.
What is thy excellence in a galliard
Faith
And I can cut the mutton to't.
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
as any man in Illyria.
Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
take dust
thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
I did think
leg
Ay
flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
Taurus! That's sides and heart.
No

On your attendance
Stand you a while aloof
To thee the book even of my secret soul:
Therefore
Be not denied access
Till thou have audience.
Sure
As it is spoke
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
Rather than make unprofited return.
Say I do speak with her
O
It shall become thee well to act my woes;
She will attend it better in thy youth
Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
I think not so
Dear lad
For they shall yet belie thy happy years
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
Is as the maiden's organ
I know thy constellation is right apt
For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
All
When least in company. Prosper well in this
I'll do my best
To woo your lady:

Nay
not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
world needs to fear no colours.
Make that good.
He shall see none to fear.
A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
saying was born
Where
In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
Well
that are fools
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and
You are resolute
Not so
That if one break

Two faults

the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend

transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
simple syllogism will serve

Sir
Misprision in the highest degree! Lady
facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
motley in my brain. Good madonna
prove you a fool.
Can you do it?
Dexterously
Make your proof.
I must catechise you for it
of virtue
Well
Good madonna
Good fool
I think his soul is in hell
I know his soul is in heaven
The more fool
soul being in heaven. Take away the fool
What think you of this fool
Yes
infirmity
better fool.
God send you
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
word for two pence that you are no fool.
How say you to that
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
than a stone. Look you now
already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
him
than the fools' zanies.
Oh
with a distempered appetite. To be generous
things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
there is no slander in an allowed fool
nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
man
Now Mercury endue thee with leasing
speakest well of fools!

drowned: go
He is but mad yet

Madam
you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
understand so much
with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
have a foreknowledge of that too
comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him
Tell him he shall not speak with me.
Has been told so; and he says
door like a sheriff's post
a bench
What kind o' man is he?
Why
What manner of man?
Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you
Of what personage and years is he?
Not yet old enough for a man
a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod
cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
in standing water
well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.

Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
Your will?
Most radiant
pray you
my speech
penned
beauties
comptible
Whence came you
I can say little more than I have studied
question's out of my part. Good gentle one
modest assurance if you be the lady of the house
Are you a comedian?
No
of malice I swear
the lady of the house?
If I do not usurp myself
Most certain
yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
on with my speech in your praise
the heart of my message.
Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
Alas
It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you
than to hear you. If you be not mad
you have reason
moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
Will you hoist sail
No
longer. Some mollification for your giant
lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
Sure
the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
war
hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
learned from my entertainment. What I am
would
Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
Now
Most sweet lady
A comfortable doctrine
Where lies your text?
In Orsino's bosom.
In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
To answer by the method
O
Good madam
Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
with my face? You are now out of your text: but
we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
Look you
not well done?
Unveiling
Excellently done
'Tis in grain
'Tis beauty truly blent
Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
Lady
And leave the world no copy.
O
out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
inventoried
labelled to my will: as
them; item
you sent hither to praise me?
I see you what you are
But
My lord and master loves you: O
Could be but recompensed
The nonpareil of beauty!
How does he love me?
With adorations
Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
Yet I suppose him virtuous
In voices well divulged
And in dimension and the shape of nature
A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
He might have took his answer long ago.
If I did love you in my master's flame
I would not understand it.
Why
Make me a willow cabin at your gate
Write loyal cantons of contemned love
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
And make the babbling gossip of the air
Cry out 'Olivia!' O

Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny

With which such scathful grapple did he make
With the most noble bottom of our fleet
Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
Orsino
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
And this is he that did the Tiger board
Here in the streets
He did me kindness
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
I know not what 'twas but distraction.
Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
Orsino
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate
That most ingrateful boy there by your side
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
His life I gave him and did thereto add
My love
Did I expose myself
Drew to defend him when he was beset:
Where being apprehended
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse
Not half an hour before.
How can this be?
When came he to this town?
To-day

As howling after music.
Still so cruel?
Still so constant

My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
Even what it please my lord
Why should I not
That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith
That screws me from my true place in your favour
But this your minion
Come
I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love
And I
Where goes Cesario?
After him I love
More than I love these eyes
If I do feign
Punish my life for tainting of my love!

Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
Call forth the holy father.

To keep in darkness what occasion now
Reveals before 'tis ripe
Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.

How have the hours rack'd and tortured me
Sebastian are you?
Fear'st thou that
How have you made division of yourself?
An apple
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
Most wonderful!
Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
Nor can there be that deity in my nature
Of charity
What countryman? what name? what parentage?
Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
Such a Sebastian was my brother too
If spirits can assume both form and suit
You come to fright us.
A spirit I am indeed;
But am in that dimension grossly clad
Which from the womb I did participate.
Were you a woman
My father had a mole upon his brow.
And so had mine.
And died that day when Viola from her birth
Had number'd thirteen years.
O
He finished indeed his mortal act
That day that made my sister thirteen years.
If nothing lets to make us happy both
But this my masculine usurp'd attire
Of place
That I am Viola: which to confirm
I was preserved to serve this noble count.
All the occurrence of my fortune since
Hath been between this lady and this lord.
[To OLIVIA]  So comes it
But nature to her bias drew in that.
You would have been contracted to a maid;
Nor are you therein
Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
If this be so

Boy
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
And all those sayings will I overswear;

As doth that orbed continent the fire
That severs day from night.
Give me thy hand;
And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.

Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
Is now in durance

And yet

Alas
But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
And now I do bethink me
First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee
This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
But when we know the grounds and authors of it
Of thine own cause.
Good madam
Taint the condition of this present hour
Set this device against Malvolio here
We had conceived against him: Maria writ
The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
In recompense whereof he hath married her.

That have on both sides pass'd.

Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine
Think on thy Proteus
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger
And on a love-book pray for my success?
Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
That's on some shallow story of deep love:
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
That's a deep story of a deeper love:
For he was more than over shoes in love.
'Tis true; for you are over boots in love
Over the boots? nay
No
What?
To be in love
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
With twenty watchful
If haply won
If lost

The eating canker dwells
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
And writers say
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow
Is turn'd to folly
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
Once more adieu! my father at the road
Expects my coming
And thither will I bring thee
Sweet Proteus

Of thy success in love
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
And likewise will visit thee with mine.

Sir Proteus
But now he parted hence
Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already
Indeed
You conclude that my master is a shepherd
I do.
Why then
A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
This proves me still a sheep.
True; and thy master a shepherd.
Nay
It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
The shepherd seeks the sheep
shepherd; but I seek my master
not me: therefore I am no sheep.
The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
But
Ay sir: I
lost mutton
Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
If the ground be overcharged
Nay: in that you are astray
Nay
carrying your letter.
You mistake; I mean the pound
From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over
your lover.
But what said she?
[First nodding]  Ay.
Nod--Ay--why
You mistook
me if she did nod; and I say
And that set together is noddy.
Now you have taken the pains to set it together
No
Well
Why sir
Marry
but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
Beshrew me
And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
Come come
Open your purse
be both at once delivered.
Well
Truly
Why
Sir
and being so hard to me that brought your mind
fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
hard as steel.
What said she? nothing?

Well of his wealth; but of himself
What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?

How now! what means this passion at his name?
Pardon
That I
Why not on Proteus
Then thus: of many good I think him best.
Your reason?
I have no other
I think him so because I think him so.
And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
Ay
Why he
Yet he
His little speaking shows his love but small.
Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
They do not love that do not show their love.

How angerly I taught my brow to frown
My penance is to call Lucetta back
And ask remission for my folly past.
What ho! Lucetta!
Re-enter LUCETTA
What would your ladyship?
Is't near dinner-time?
I would it were
And not upon your maid.
What is't that you took up so gingerly?
Nothing.
Why didst thou stoop
To take a paper up that I let fall.
And is that paper nothing?
Nothing concerning me.
Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
Madam
Unless it have a false interpeter.
Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
That I might sing it
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
As little by such toys as may be possible.
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
It is too heavy for so light a tune.
Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
Ay
And why not you?
I cannot reach so high.
Let's see your song. How now
Keep tune there still
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
You do not?
No
You
Nay
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
Indeed
This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
Here is a coil with protestation!
Tears the letter
Go get you gone
You would be fingering them
She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
To be so anger'd with another letter.
Exit
Nay
O hateful hands
Injurious wasps
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
Look
As in revenge of thy ingratitude
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
Be calm
Till I have found each letter in the letter
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
And throw it thence into the raging sea!
Lo
And yet I will not
He couples it to his complaining names.
Thus will I fold them one on another:
Now kiss
Re-enter LUCETTA
Madam
Well
What
If you respect them
Nay
Yet here they shall not lie
I see you have a month's mind to them.
Ay
I see things too
Come
Exeunt
SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.
Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO
Tell me
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
'Twas of his nephew Proteus
Why
He wonder'd that your lordship
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home
Some to the wars
Some to discover islands far away;
Some to the studious universities.
For any or for all these exercises
To let him spend his time no more at home
Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
Whereon this month I have been hammering.
I have consider'd well his loss of time
And how he cannot be a perfect man
Experience is by industry achieved
And perfected by the swift course of time.
Then tell me
I think your lordship is not ignorant
How his companion
I know it well.
'Twere good
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments
And be in eye of every exercise
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it
Even with the speediest expedition
I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
To-morrow
And to commend their service to his will.
Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
And
Enter PROTEUS
Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
Here is her hand
Here is her oath for love
O
O heavenly Julia!
How now! what letter are you reading there?
May't please your lordship
Of commendations sent from Valentine
Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
There is no news
How happily he lives
And daily graced by the emperor;
Wishing me with him
And how stand you affected to his wish?
As one relying on your lordship's will
And not depending on his friendly wish.
My will is something sorted with his wish.
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
For what I will
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
What maintenance he from his friends receives
To-morrow be in readiness to go:
Excuse it not
My lord
Please you
Look
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
Come on
To hasten on his expedition.
Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO
Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning
I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
Hath he excepted most against my love.
O
The uncertain glory of an April day
Re-enter PANTHINO
Sir Proteus
He is in haste; therefore

Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
Sir
Not mine; my gloves are on.
Why
Ha! let me see: ay
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
Ah
Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
How now
She is not within hearing
Why
Your worship
Well
And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
Go to
She that your worship loves?
Why
Marry

buried her grandam; to fast

on you
Are all these things perceived in me?
They are all perceived without ye.
Without me? they cannot.
Without you? nay
were so simple
without these follies
you and shine through you like the water in an
urinal
physician to comment on your malady.
But tell me
She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
Hast thou observed that? even she
Why
Dost thou know her by my gazing on her
knowest her not?
Is she not hard-favoured
Not so fair
Sir
What dost thou know?
That she is not so fair as
I mean that her beauty is exquisite
That's because the one is painted and the other out
of all count.
How painted? and how out of count?
Marry
man counts of her beauty.
How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
You never saw her since she was deformed.
How long hath she been deformed?
Ever since you loved her.
I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
see her beautiful.
If you love her
Why?
Because Love is blind. O
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
ungartered!
What should I see then?
Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
for he
hose
Belike
morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
TRUE
bolder to chide you for yours.
In conclusion
I would you were set
Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
one she loves.
And have you?
I have.
Are they not lamely writ?
No
here she comes.
[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
Now will he interpret to her.
Enter SILVIA
Madam and mistress
[Aside]  O
Sir Valentine and servant
[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.
As you enjoin'd me
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
But for my duty to your ladyship.
I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
Now trust me
For being ignorant to whom it goes
I writ at random
Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
No
Please you command
A pretty period! Well
And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
And yet take this again; and yet I thank you
[Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'
What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
Yes
But since unwillingly
Nay
Madam
Ay
But I will none of them; they are for you;
I would have had them writ more movingly.
Please you
And when it's writ
If it please me
Why
And so
Exit
O jest unseen
My master sues to her
taught her suitor
O excellent device! was there ever heard a better
the letter?
How now
Nay
To do what?
To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
To whom?
To yourself: why
What figure?
By a letter
Why
What need she
yourself? Why
No
No believing you
her earnest?
She gave me none
Why
That's the letter I writ to her friend.
And that letter hath she delivered
I would it were no worse.
I'll warrant you
For often have you writ to her
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover
All this I speak in print
Why muse you
I have dined.
Ay
feed on the air
victuals
your mistress; be moved
Exeunt
SCENE II. Verona. JULIA'S house.
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
Have patience
I must
When possibly I can
If you turn not
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
Giving a ring
Why then
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
Here is my hand for my true constancy;
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
My father stays my coming; answer not;
The tide is now: nay
That tide will stay me longer than I should.

Exit JULIA

Ay
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
Enter PANTHINO
Sir Proteus
Go; I come
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.

now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
now should I kiss my father; well
come I to my mother: O
like a wood woman! Well
'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.
Enter PANTHINO
Launce
and thou art to post after with oars. What's the
matter? why weepest thou

It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
What's the unkindest tide?

Seem you that you are not?
Haply I do.
So do counterfeits.
So do you.
What seem I that I am not?
Wise.
What instance of the contrary?

And how quote you my folly?
I quote it in your jerkin.
My jerkin is a doublet.
Well

That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live

Enter DUKE
Now
Sir Valentine
What say you to a letter from your friends
Of much good news?
My lord
To any happy messenger from thence.
Know ye Don Antonio
Ay
To be of worth and worthy estimation
And not without desert so well reputed.
Hath he not a son?
Ay
The honour and regard of such a father.
You know him well?
I know him as myself; for from our infancy
We have conversed and spent our hours together:
And though myself have been an idle truant
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection
His years but young
His head unmellow'd
And
Comes all the praises that I now bestow
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
Beshrew me
As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
Well
And here he means to spend his time awhile:
I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
Should I have wish'd a thing
Welcome him then according to his worth.
Silvia
For Valentine
I will send him hither to you presently.
Exit
This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
Had come along with me
Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
Upon some other pawn for fealty.
Nay
Nay
How could he see his way to seek out you?
Why
They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
To see such lovers
Upon a homely object Love can wink.
Have done
Exit THURIO
Enter PROTEUS
Welcome
His worth is warrant for his welcome hither
Mistress
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
Not so
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
Leave off discourse of disability:
Sweet lady
My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
And duty never yet did want his meed:
Servant
I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
That you are welcome?
That you are worthless.
Re-enter THURIO
Madam
I wait upon his pleasure. Come
I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
When you have done
We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO
Now
Your friends are well and have them much commended.
And how do yours?
I left them all in health.
How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
My tales of love were wont to weary you;
I know you joy not in a love discourse.
Ay
I have done penance for contemning Love
With bitter fasts
For in revenge of my contempt of love
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
O gentle Proteus
Now no discourse
Now can I break my fast
Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
Was this the idol that you worship so?
Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
No; but she is an earthly paragon.
Call her divine.
I will not flatter her.
O
When I was sick
Then speak the truth by her; if not divine
Except my mistress.
Sweet
Except thou wilt except against my love.
Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
And I will help thee to prefer her too:
She shall be dignified with this high honour--
To bear my lady's train
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
And
And make rough winter everlastingly.
Why
Pardon me
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
She is alone.
Then let her alone.
Not for the world: why
As twenty seas
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee
My foolish rival
Only for his possessions are so huge
But she loves you?
Ay
Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
Good Proteus
Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
I must unto the road
Some necessaries that I needs must use
Will you make haste?
I will.
Exit VALENTINE
Even as one heat another heat expels
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
Is it mine
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
That I did love
Which
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold
O
How shall I dote on her with more advice
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld
But when I look on her perfections
If I can cheque my erring love
If not
Exit
SCENE V. The same. A street.
Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally
Launce! by mine honesty
Forswear not thyself
welcome. I reckon this always
undone till he be hanged
place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
say 'Welcome!'
Come on
presently; where
shalt have five thousand welcomes. But
did thy master part with Madam Julia?
Marry
fairly in jest.
But shall she marry him?
No.
How then? shall he marry her?
No
What
No
Why
Marry
stands well with her.
What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
What a block art thou
staff understands me.
What thou sayest?
Ay
It stands under thee
Why
But tell me true
Ask my dog: if he say ay
The conclusion is then that it will.
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
'Tis well that I get it so. But
thou
I never knew him otherwise.
Than how?
A notable lubber
Why
Why
I tell thee
Why
in love. If thou wilt
if not
name of a Christian.
Why?
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
At thy service.
Exeunt
SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.
Enter PROTEUS
To leave my Julia
To love fair Silvia
To wrong my friend
And even that power which gave me first my oath
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
O sweet-suggesting Love
At first I did adore a twinkling star
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
Fie
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
I cannot leave to love
But there I leave to love where I should love.
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
If I keep them
If I lose them
For Valentine myself
I to myself am dearer than a friend
And Silvia--witness Heaven
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
I will forget that Julia is alive
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy
I cannot now prove constant to myself
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window
Now presently I'll give her father notice
Of their disguising and pretended flight;
Who
For Thurio
But
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
Love
Exit
SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.
Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
Counsel
And even in kind love I do conjure thee
Are visibly character'd and engraved
How
A journey to my loving Proteus.
Alas
A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly
Better forbear till Proteus make return.
O
Pity the dearth that I have pined in
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire
The more thou damm'st it up
The current that with gentle murmur glides
But when his fair course is not hindered
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage
With willing sport to the wild ocean.
Then let me go and hinder not my course
I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
And make a pastime of each weary step
And there I'll rest
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
But in what habit will you go along?
Not like a woman; for I would prevent
The loose encounters of lascivious men:
Gentle Lucetta
As may beseem some well-reputed page.
Why
No
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
To be fantastic may become a youth
Of greater time than I shall show to be.
What fashion
That fits as well as 'Tell me
Why even what fashion thou best likest
You must needs have them with a codpiece
Out
A round hose
Lucetta
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
But tell me
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
I fear me
If you think so
Nay
Then never dream on infamy
If Proteus like your journey when you come
I fear me
That is the least
A thousand oaths
And instances of infinite of love
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
All these are servants to deceitful men.
Base men
But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
His words are bonds
Pray heaven he prove so
Now
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
Only deserve my love by loving him;
And presently go with me to my chamber
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose
Only
Come
I am impatient of my tarriance.
Exeunt
ACT III
SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.
Enter DUKE
Sir Thurio
We have some secrets to confer about.
Exit THURIO
Now
My gracious lord
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
But when I call to mind your gracious favours
Done to me
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
Know
Myself am one made privy to the plot.
I know you have determined to bestow her
On Thurio
And should she thus be stol'n away from you
Thus
To cross my friend in his intended drift
Than
A pack of sorrows which would press you down
Proteus
Which to requite
This love of theirs myself have often seen
Sir Valentine her company and my court:
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so unworthily disgrace the man
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
And
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
Know
How he her chamber-window will ascend
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
For which the youthful lover now is gone
And this way comes he with it presently;
Where
But
That my discovery be not aimed at;
For love of you
Upon mine honour
That I had any light from thee of this.
Adieu
Exit
Enter VALENTINE
Sir Valentine
Please it your grace
That stays to bear my letters to my friends
Be they of much import?
The tenor of them doth but signify
My health and happy being at your court.
Nay then
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
I know it well
Were rich and honourable; besides
Is full of virtue
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
No
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
And
And
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty
And turn her out to who will take her in:
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
For me and my possessions she esteems not.
What would your Grace have me to do in this?
There is a lady in Verona here
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
For long agone I have forgot to court;
Besides
How and which way I may bestow myself
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
Win her with gifts
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
Send her another; never give her o'er;
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
If she do frown
If she do chide
For why
Take no repulse
For 'get you gone
Flatter and praise
Though ne'er so black
That man that hath a tongue
But she I mean is promised by her friends
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth
Why
Ay
What lets but one may enter at her window?
Her chamber is aloft
Without apparent hazard of his life.
Why then
Now
When would you use it? pray
This very night; for Love is like a child
By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
But
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
It will be light
Under a cloak that is of any length.
A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
Ay
Then let me see thy cloak:
I'll get me one of such another length.
Why
How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
I pray thee
What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
Reads
'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly
O
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
While I
I curse myself
What's here?
'Silvia
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
Why
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
Wilt thou reach stars
Go
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
But
Exit
And why not death rather than living torment?
To die is to be banish'd from myself;
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
What light is light
What joy is joy
Unless it be to think that she is by
And feed upon the shadow of perfection
Except I be by Silvia in the night
Unless I look on Silvia in the day
She is my essence
Foster'd
I fly not death
Tarry I here
But
Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE
Run
Soho
What seest thou?
Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
but 'tis a Valentine.
Valentine?
No.
Who then? his spirit?
Neither.
What then?
Nothing.
Can nothing speak? Master
Who wouldst thou strike?
Nothing.
Villain
Why
Sirrah
My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news
Then in dumb silence will I bury mine
Is Silvia dead?
No
No Valentine
Hath she forsworn me?
No
No Valentine
What is your news?
Sir
That thou art banished--O
From hence
O
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
Ay
Which
A sea of melting pearl
Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
With them
Wringing her hands
As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
But neither bended knees
But Valentine
Besides
No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
Have some malignant power upon my life:
If so
Cease to lament for that thou canst not help
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
Here if thou stay
Besides
Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
And manage it against despairing thoughts.
Thy letters may be here
Which
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
The time now serves not to expostulate:
Come
And
Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
As thou lovest Silvia
I pray thee
Go
O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS
I am but a fool
think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
all one
that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a
team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who
'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman
will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet
'tis not a maid
a maid
wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;
which is much in a bare Christian.
Pulling out a paper
Here is the cate-log of her condition.
'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why
can do no more: nay
carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:
She can milk;' look you
with clean hands.
Enter SPEED
How now
mastership?
With my master's ship? why
Well
news
The blackest news that ever thou heardest.
Why
Why
Let me read them.
Fie on thee
Thou liest; I can.
I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?
Marry
O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
Come
There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!
[Reads]  'Imprimis: She can milk.'
Ay
'Item: She brews good ale.'
And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your
heart
'Item: She can sew.'
That's as much as to say
'Item: She can knit.'
What need a man care for a stock with a wench
she can knit him a stock?
'Item: She can wash and scour.'
A special virtue: for then she need not be washed
and scoured.
'Item: She can spin.'
Then may I set the world on wheels
spin for her living.
'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
That's as much as to say
'Here follow her vices.'
Close at the heels of her virtues.
'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect
of her breath.'
Well
'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
That makes amends for her sour breath.
'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
It's no matter for that
'Item: She is slow in words.'
O villain
be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
thee
'Item: She is proud.'
Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy

'Item: She hath no teeth.'
I care not for that neither
'Item: She is curst.'
Well
'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
If her liquor be good
will; for good things should be praised.
'Item: She is too liberal.'
Of her tongue she cannot
is slow of; of her purse she shall not
I'll keep shut: now
that cannot I help. Well
'Item: She hath more hair than wit
than hairs
Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine
mine
Rehearse that once more.
'Item: She hath more hair than wit
More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The
cover of the salt hides the salt
is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
is more than the wit
less. What's next?
'And more faults than hairs
That's monstrous: O
'And more wealth than faults.'
Why
impossible
What then?
Why
for thee at the North-gate.
For me?
For thee! ay
better man than thee.
And must I go to him?
Thou must run to him
that going will scarce serve the turn.
Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!

Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an
unmannerly slave

SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.
Enter DUKE and THURIO
Sir Thurio
Since his exile she hath despised me most
This weak impress of love is as a figure
Trenched in ice
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
Enter PROTEUS
How now
According to our proclamation gone?
Gone
My daughter takes his going grievously.
A little time
So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
Proteus
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
Makes me the better to confer with thee.
Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
Let me not live to look upon your grace.
Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
I do
And also
How she opposes her against my will
She did
Ay
What might we do to make the girl forget
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
The best way is to slander Valentine
With falsehood
Ay
Ay
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
Then you must undertake to slander him.
And that
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman
Where your good word cannot advantage him
Therefore the office is indifferent
You have prevail'd
By ought that I can speak in his dispraise
But say this weed her love from Valentine
Therefore
Which must be done by praising me as much
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
And
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
Upon this warrant shall you have access
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
For she is lumpish
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
As much as I can do
But you
You must lay lime to tangle her desires
By wailful sonnets
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
Ay
Say that upon the altar of her beauty
You sacrifice your tears
Write till your ink be dry
Moist it again
That may discover such integrity:
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
After your dire-lamenting elegies
With some sweet concert; to their instruments
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
This
This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
Therefore
To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
To give the onset to thy good advice.
About it
We'll wait upon your grace till after supper
Even now about it! I will pardon you.

If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
Sir
That all the travellers do fear so much.
My friends
That's not so
Peace! we'll hear him.
Ay
Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
My riches are these poor habiliments
Whither travel you?
To Verona.
Whence came you?
From Milan.
Have you long sojourned there?
Some sixteen months
What
I was.
For what offence?
For that which now torments me to rehearse:
I kill'd a man
Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight
Why
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
I was
Have you the tongues?
My youthful travel therein made me happy
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar
We'll have him. Sirs
Master
Peace
Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
Nothing but my fortune.
Know
Thrust from the company of awful men:
Myself was from Verona banished
For practising to steal away a lady
And I from Mantua
And I for such like petty crimes as these
And partly
With goodly shape and by your own report
A linguist and a man of such perfection
As we do in our quality much want--
Indeed
Are you content to be our general?
To make a virtue of necessity
And live
What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
Say ay
We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee
But if thou scorn our courtesy
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
I take your offer and will live with you
On silly women or poor passengers.
No
Come

SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace
Enter PROTEUS
Already have I been false to Valentine
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
Under the colour of commending him
But Silvia is too fair
When I protest true loyalty to her
When to her beauty I commend my vows
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips
But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window
Enter THURIO and Musicians
How now
Ay
Will creep in service where it cannot go.
Ay
Sir
Who? Silvia?
Ay
I thank you for your own. Now
Enter
Now
pray you
Marry
Come
you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
But shall I hear him speak?
Ay
That will be music.
Music plays
Hark
Is he among these?
Ay: but
SONG.
Who is Silvia? what is she
Holy
The heaven such grace did lend her
Is she kind as she is fair?
For beauty lives with kindness.
Love doth to her eyes repair
Then to Silvia let us sing
She excels each mortal thing
Upon the dull earth dwelling:
To her let us garlands bring.
How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
do you
You mistake; the musician likes me not.
Why
He plays false
How? out of tune on the strings?
Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
heart-strings.
You have a quick ear.
Ay
I perceive you delight not in music.
Not a whit
Hark
Ay
You would have them always play but one thing?
I would always have one play but one thing.
But
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
I tell you what Launce
her out of all nick.
Where is Launce?
Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow
master's command
Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
Sir Thurio
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
Where meet we?
At Saint Gregory's well.
Farewell.

Enter SILVIA above
Madam
I thank you for your music
Who is that that spake?

Sir Proteus
Sir Proteus
What's your will?
That I may compass yours.
You have your wish; my will is even this:
That presently you hie you home to bed.
Thou subtle
Think'st thou I am so shallow
Return
For me
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
I grant
But she is dead.
[Aside]        'Twere false
For I am sure she is not buried.
Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
Survives; to whom
To wrong him with thy importunacy?
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
And so suppose am I; for in his grave
Assure thyself my love is buried.
Sweet lady
Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence
[Aside]  He heard not that.
Madam
To that I'll speak
For since the substance of your perfect self
Is else devoted
And to your shadow will I make true love.
[Aside]  If 'twere a substance
I am very loath to be your idol
But since your falsehood shall become you well
To worship shadows and adore false shapes
And so
As wretches have o'ernight
That wait for execution in the morn.

SCENE III. The same.
Enter EGLAMOUR
This is the hour that Madam Silvia
Entreated me to call and know her mind:
There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
Madam
Enter SILVIA above
Who calls?
Your servant and your friend;
One that attends your ladyship's command.
Sir Eglamour
As many
According to your ladyship's impose
It is your pleasure to command me in.
O Eglamour
Think not I flatter
Valiant
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine
Vain Thurio
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
As when thy lady and thy true love died
Sir Eglamour
And
Urge not my father's anger
I do desire thee
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands
If not
Madam
Which since I know they virtuously are placed
As much I wish all good befortune you.
When will you go?
This evening coming.
Where shall I meet you?
At Friar Patrick's cell
I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow
Good morrow
Exeunt severally
SCENE IV. The same.
Enter LAUNCE
When a man's servant shall play the cur with him
puppy; one that I saved from drowning
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
I have taught him
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
O
in all companies! I would have
more wit than he
live
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while
all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
I
whips the dogs: 'Friend
the dog?' 'Ay
the more wrong
wot of.' He makes me no more ado
of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
his servant? Nay
stocks for puddings he hath stolen
been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
he hath killed
Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
thou ever see me do such a trick?
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
And will employ thee in some service presently.
In what you please: I'll do what I can.
I hope thou wilt.
To LAUNCE
How now
Where have you been these two days loitering?
Marry
And what says she to my little jewel?
Marry
currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
But she received my dog?
No
back again.
What
Ay
the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
offered her mine own
yours
Go get thee hence
Away
Exit LAUNCE
A slave
Sebastian
That can with some discretion do my business
Therefore know thou
Go presently and take this ring with thee
She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
It seems you loved not her
She is dead
Not so; I think she lives.
Alas!
Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
I cannot choose
But pity her.
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
Because methinks that she loved you as well
As you do love your lady Silvia:
She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
You dote on her that cares not for your love.
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
Well
This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
Your message done
Exit
How many women would do such a message?
Alas
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
Alas
That with his very heart despiseth me?
Because he loves her
Because I love him I must pity him.
This ring I gave him when he parted from me
And now am I
I am my master's true-confirmed love;
But cannot be true servant to my master
Yet will I woo for him
As
Enter SILVIA
Gentlewoman
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
What would you with her
If you be she
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
From whom?
From my master
O
Ay
Ursula
Go give your master this: tell him from me
Madam
Pardon me
Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
This is the letter to your ladyship.
I pray thee
It may not be; good madam
There
I will not look upon your master's lines:
I know they are stuff'd with protestations
And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
As easily as I do tear his paper.
Madam
The more shame for him that he sends it me;
For I have heard him say a thousand times
His Julia gave it him at his departure.
Though his false finger have profaned the ring
She thanks you.
What say'st thou?
I thank you
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
Dost thou know her?
Almost as well as I do know myself:
To think upon her woes I do protest
That I have wept a hundred several times.
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
Is she not passing fair?
She hath been fairer
When she did think my master loved her well
But since she did neglect her looking-glass
And threw her sun-expelling mask away
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face
How tall was she?
About my stature; for at Pentecost
Therefore I know she is about my height.
And at that time I made her weep agood
Madam
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
Which I so lively acted with my tears
That my poor mistress
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
She is beholding to thee
Alas
I weep myself to think upon thy words.
Here
For thy sweet mistress' sake
Farewell.
Exit SILVIA
And she shall thank you for't
A virtuous gentlewoman
I hope my master's suit will be but cold
Alas
Here is her picture: let me see; I think
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little
Her hair is auburn
If that be all the difference in his love
Her eyes are grey as glass
Ay
What should it be that he respects in her
But I can make respective in myself
Come
And
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake
To make my master out of love with thee!

Sir Proteus
O
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
What
No; that it is too little.
I'll wear a boot
[Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what
it loathes.
What says she to my face?
She says it is a fair one.
Nay then
But pearls are fair; and the old saying is
[Aside]  'Tis true; such pearls as put out
ladies' eyes;
For I had rather wink than look on them.
How likes she my discourse?
Ill
But well
[Aside]  But better
What says she to my valour?
O
[Aside]  She needs not
What says she to my birth?
That you are well derived.
[Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
Considers she my possessions?
O
Wherefore?
[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
That they are out by lease.
Here comes the duke.
Enter DUKE
How now
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?
Not I.
Nor I.
Saw you my daughter?
Neither.
Why then
And Eglamour is in her company.
'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both
Him he knew well
Besides
At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
Therefore
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
That leads towards Mantua
Dispatch

I'll after
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.

And I will follow
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.

Come
A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
Come
Where is the gentleman that was with her?
Being nimble-footed
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.
Come
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind
O Valentine
Exeunt
SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.
Enter VALENTINE
How use doth breed a habit in a man!
This shadowy desert
Here can I sit alone
Tune my distresses and record my woes.
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast
And leave no memory of what it was!
Repair me with thy presence
Thou gentle nymph
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
These are my mates
They love me well; yet I have much to do
To keep them from uncivil outrages.
Withdraw thee
Enter PROTEUS
Madam
That would have forced your honour and your love;
Vouchsafe me
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
And less than this
[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
Love
O miserable
Unhappy were you
But by my coming I have made you happy.
By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
[Aside]  And me
Had I been seized by a hungry lion
O
And full as much
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
What dangerous action
O
When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
Read over Julia's heart
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
Descended into perjury
Thou hast no faith left now
And that's far worse than none; better have none
Than plural faith which is too much by one:
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
In love
Who respects friend?
All men but Proteus.
Nay
Can no way change you to a milder form
O heaven!
I'll force thee yield to my desire.
Ruffian
Valentine!
Thou common friend
Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
Who should be trusted
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst
My shame and guilt confounds me.
Forgive me
Be a sufficient ransom for offence
As e'er I did commit.
Then I am paid;
And once again I do receive thee honest.
Who by repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heaven nor earth
By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
And
O me unhappy!
Swoons
Look to the boy.
Why
Look up; speak.
O good sir
to Madam Silvia
Where is that ring
Here 'tis; this is it.
How! let me see:
Why
O
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
I gave this unto Julia.
And Julia herself did give it me;
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
How! Julia!
Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
O Proteus
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
Such an immodest raiment
In a disguise of love:
It is the lesser blot
Than men their minds! 'tis true.
O heaven! were man
But constant
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
What is in Silvia's face
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
Come
Let me be blest to make this happy close;
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
Bear witness
And I mine.
Enter Outlaws
A prize
Forbear
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced
Sir Valentine!
Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
Thurio
Come not within the measure of my wrath;
Do not name Silvia thine; if once again
Take but possession of her with a touch:
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
Sir Valentine
I hold him but a fool that will endanger
His body for a girl that loves him not:
I claim her not
The more degenerate and base art thou
And leave her on such slight conditions.
Now
Know then
Take thou thy Silvia
I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
I now beseech you
I grant it
These banish'd men that I have kept withal
Are men endued with worthy qualities:
Forgive them what they have committed here
And let them be recall'd from their exile:
They are reformed
And fit for great employment
Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:
Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
Come
With triumphs
And
With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
What think you of this page
I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
I warrant you
What mean you by that saying?

I think
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed--
Beseech you
Verily
we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks
us.
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
Believe me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society
with interchange of gifts
embassies; that they have seemed to be together
embraced
winds. The heavens continue their loves!
I think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note.
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
subject
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a man.
Would they else be content to die?
Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live.
If the king had no son
on crutches till he had one.

Enter LEONTES
Nine changes of the watery star hath been
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
Without a burthen: time as long again
Would be find up
And yet we should
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
That go before it.
Stay your thanks a while;
And pay them when you part.
Sir
I am question'd by my fears
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
No sneaping winds at home
'This is put forth too truly:' besides
To tire your royalty.
We are tougher
No longer stay.
One seven-night longer.
Very sooth
We'll part the time between's then; and in that
I'll no gainsaying.
Press me not
There is no tongue that moves
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
To you a charge and trouble: to save both
Tongue-tied
speak you.
I had thought
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him
Well said
To tell
But let him say so then
But let him swear so
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
You take my lord
To let him there a month behind the gest
Prefix'd for's parting: yet
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
No
Nay
I may not
Verily!
You put me off with limber vows; but I
stars with oaths
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
Force me to keep you as a prisoner
When you depart
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily
One of them you shall be.
Your guest
To be your prisoner should import offending;
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish.
Not your gaoler
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
You were pretty lordings then?
We were
But such a day to-morrow as to-day
Was not my lord
The verier wag o' the two?
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
The doctrine of ill-doing
That any did. Had we pursued that life
With stronger blood
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
Hereditary ours.
By this we gather
You have tripp'd since.
O my most sacred lady!
Temptations have since then been born to's; for
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
Of my young play-fellow.
Grace to boot!
Of this make no conclusion
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
The offences we have made you do we'll answer
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
With any but with us.
Is he won yet?
He'll stay my lord.
At my request he would not.
Hermione
To better purpose.
Never?
Never
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
What was my first? it has an elder sister
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
Nay
Why
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
'I am yours for ever.'
'Tis grace indeed.
Why
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
The other for some while a friend.
"[Aside]	Too hot"
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
May a free face put on
From heartiness
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers

My bosom likes not
Ay

They say it is a copy out of mine. Come
And yet the steer
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
Upon his palm!--How now
Art thou my calf?
Yes
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have
Almost as like as eggs; women say so
As o'er-dyed blacks
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
No bourn 'twixt his and mine
To say this boy were like me. Come
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
Thou dost make possible things not so held
With what's unreal thou coactive art
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost

What means Sicilia?
He something seems unsettled.
How
What cheer? how is't with you
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
Are you moved
No
How sometimes nature will betray its folly
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
Of my boy's face
Twenty-three years
How like
No
You will! why

If at home
He makes a July's day short as December
Thoughts that would thick my blood.
So stands this squire
Officed with me: we two will walk
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
Next to thyself and my young rover
Apparent to my heart.
If you would seek us
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found
Aside
I am angling now
Go to
How she holds up the neb
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband!
Exeunt POLIXENES
Gone already!
Inch-thick
ears a fork'd one!
Go
Play too
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
Will be my knell. Go
There have been
And many a man there is
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour
Sir Smile
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd
That have revolted wives
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
It is a bawdy planet
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful
It will let in and out the enemy
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
Have the disease
I am like you
Why that's some comfort. What
Ay
Go play
Exit MAMILLIUS
Camillo
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
When you cast out
Didst note it?
He would not stay at your petitions: made
His business more material.
Didst perceive it?
Aside
They're here with me already
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone
At the good queen's entreaty.
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
But
By any understanding pate but thine?
For thy conceit is soaking
More than the common blocks: not noted
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
Business
Bohemia stays here longer.
Ha!
Stays here longer.
Ay
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress.
Satisfy!
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee
My chamber-councils
Hast cleansed my bosom
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
Deceived in thy integrity
In that which seems so.
Be it forbid
To bide upon't
From course required; or else thou must be counted
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent; or else a fool
That seest a game play'd home
My gracious lord
In every one of these no man is free
I play'd the fool
To do a thing
Against the non-performance
Which oft infects the wisest: these
Is never free of. But
By its own visage: if I then deny it
Ha' not you seen
But that's past doubt
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Cannot be mute
Resides not in that man that does not think
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess
My wife's a hobby-horse
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
I would not be a stander-by to hear
My sovereign mistress clouded so
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart
Than this; which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that
Is whispering nothing?
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
Hours
Blind with the pin and web but theirs
Why
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings
Good my lord
Of this diseased opinion
For 'tis most dangerous.
Say it be
No
It is; you lie
I say thou liest
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
Infected as her life
The running of one glass.
Who does infect her?
Why
About his neck
Had servants true about me
To see alike mine honour as their profits
Which should undo more doing: ay
Have benched and reared to worship
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
Which draught to me were cordial.
Sir
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
I have loved thee
Make that thy question
Dost think I am so muddy
The purity and whiteness of my sheets
Is goads
Could man so blench?
I must believe you
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
Provided that
Will take again your queen as yours at first
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours.
Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down:
I'll give no blemish to her honour
My lord
As friendship wears at feasts
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
If from me he have wholesome beverage
This is all:
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
Do't not
I'll do't
I will seem friendly
Exit
O miserable lady! But
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
Is the obedience to a master
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too. To do this deed
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
And flourish'd after
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
Forsake the court: to do't
To me a break-neck. Happy star
Here comes Bohemia.
Re-enter POLIXENES
This is strange: methinks
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
Good day
Hail
What is the news i' the court?
None rare
The king hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
With customary compliment; when he
A lip of much contempt
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
That changeth thus his manners.
I dare not know
How! dare not! do not. Do you know
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
For
And cannot say
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
A party in this alteration
Myself thus alter'd with 't.
There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
Of you that yet are well.
How! caught of me!
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
I have look'd on thousands
By my regard
As you are certainly a gentleman
Clerk-like experienced
Our gentry than our parents' noble names
Thereof to be inform'd
In ignorant concealment.
I may not answer.
A sickness caught of me
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear
Which honour does acknowledge
Is not this suit of mine
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping toward me; how far off
Which way to be prevented
If not
Sir
Since I am charged in honour and by him
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel
I mean to utter it
Cry lost
On
I am appointed him to murder you.
By whom
By the king.
For what?
He thinks
To vice you to't
Forbiddenly.
O
To an infected jelly and my name
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
Turn then my freshest reputation to
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
Where I arrive
That e'er was heard or read!
Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly
Is piled upon his faith and will continue
The standing of his body.
How should this grow?
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
If therefore you dare trust my honesty
Shall bear along impawn'd
Your followers I will whisper to the business
Clear them o' the city. For myself
My fortunes to your service
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
For
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth
His execution sworn.
I do believe thee:
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two days ago. This jealousy
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
Profess'd to him
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
Good expedition be my friend
The gracious queen
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come
I will respect thee as a father if
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
To take the urgent hour. Come
Exeunt
ACT II
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
Enter HERMIONE
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me
Come
No
Why
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
I were a baby still. I love you better.
And why so
Not for because
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows
Too much hair there
Or a half-moon made with a pen.
Who taught you this?
I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
What colour are your eyebrows?
Blue
Nay
That has been blue
Hark ye;
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us
She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come
I am for you again: pray you
Merry or sad shall't be?
As merry as you will.
A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
Of sprites and goblins.
Let's have that
Come on
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.
There was a man--
Nay
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
Yond crickets shall not hear it.
Come on
Enter LEONTES
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
Even to their ships.
How blest am I
In my just censure
Alack
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd
Is not infected: but if one present
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye
How he hath drunk
Camillo was his help in this
There is a plot against my life
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
He has discover'd my design
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea
For them to play at will. How came the posterns
So easily open?
By his great authority;
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
On your command.
I know't too well.
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
Though he does bear some signs of me
Have too much blood in him.
What is this? sport?
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
Away with him! and let her sport herself
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
Has made thee swell thus.
But I'ld say he had not
You
To say 'she is a goodly lady
The justice of your bearts will thereto add
'Tis pity she's not honest
Praise her but for this her without-door form
The shrug
That calumny doth use--O
That mercy does
Virtue itself: these shrugs
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known
Should a villain say so
You have mistook
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
More
A federary with her
What she should shame to know herself
But with her most vile principal
A bed-swerver
That vulgars give bold'st titles
To this their late escape.
No
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord
You did mistake.
No; if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks.
There's some ill planet reigns:
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
That honourable grief lodged here which burns
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all
Shall best instruct you
The king's will be perform'd!
Shall I be heard?
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness
My plight requires it. Do not weep
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
Has deserved prison
As I come out: this action I now go on
Is for my better grace. Adieu
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
I trust I shall. My women
Go
Exit HERMIONE
Beseech your highness
Be certain what you do
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer
For her
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean
If it prove
She's otherwise
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
For every inch of woman in the world
Hold your peaces.
Good my lord
It is for you we speak
You are abused and by some putter-on
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain
The second and the third
If this prove true
by mine honour
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue.
Cease; no more.
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
As you feel doing thus; and see withal
The instruments that feel.
If it be so
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
Of the whole dungy earth.
What! lack I credit?
I had rather you did lack than I
To have her honour true than your suspicion
Why
Commune with you of this
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels
Imparts this; which if you
Or seeming so in skill
Relish a truth like us
We need no more of your advice: the matter
Properly ours.
And I wish
How could that be?
Either thou art most ignorant by age
But only seeing
Made up to the deed
Yet
Most piteous to be wild
To sacred Delphos
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had
Well done
Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know
Give rest to the minds of others
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
From our free person she should be confined
Be left her to perform. Come
We are to speak in public; for this business
Will raise us all.

If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
And never to my red-look'd anger be

How he may soften at the sight o' the child:

A thriving issue: there is no lady living
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
To visit the next room
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;

I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
As boldness from my bosom

Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
The cause were not in being
Is quite beyond mine arm
And level of my brain
I can hook to me: say that she were gone
Might come to me again. Who's there?
My lord?
How does the boy?
He took good rest to-night;
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
To see his nobleness!
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother

Until a time may serve: for present vengeance
Laugh at me

Shall she within my power.
Enter PAULINA
You must not enter.
Nay
Fear you his tyrannous passion more
That's enough.
Madam
None should come at him.
Not so hot
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you
At each his needless heavings
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
Do come with words as medicinal as true
That presses him from sleep.
What noise there
No noise
About some gossips for your highness.
How!
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus
I knew she would.
I told her so
What
From all dishonesty he can: in this
La you now
When she will take the rein I let her run;
But she'll not stumble.
Good my liege
And
Myself your loyal servant
Less appear so in comforting your evils
From your good queen.
Good queen!
Good queen
And would by combat make her good
A man
Force her hence.
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
Laying down the child
Out!
A mankind witch! Hence with her
A most intelligencing bawd!
Not so:
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me
Than you are mad; which is enough
Traitors!
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
Take't up
For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
Which he has put upon't!
He dreads his wife.
So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
You'ld call your children yours.
A nest of traitors!
I am none
Nor I
But one that's here
The sacred honour of himself
and will not--
For
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
The root of his opinion
As ever oak or stone was sound.
A callat
Of boundless tongue
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
It is the issue of Polixenes:
Hence with it
Commit them to the fire!
It is yours;
And
And copy of the father
And thou
So like to him that got it
The ordering of the mind too
No yellow in't
A gross hag
And
Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat
Hardly one subject.
Once more
A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more.
I'll ha' thee burnt.
I care not:
It is an heretic that makes the fire
But this most cruel usage of your queen
Than your own weak-hinged fancy
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you
On your allegiance
I pray you
Look to your babe
Jove send her
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
You
So
Exit
Thou
My child? away with't! Even thou
A heart so tender o'er it
And see it instantly consumed with fire;
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done
And wilt encounter with my wrath
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out. Go
For thou set'st on thy wife.
I did not
These lords
We can: my royal liege
You're liars all.
Beseech your highness
We have always truly served you
So to esteem of us
Past and to come
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
I am a feather for each wind that blows:
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And call me father? better burn it now
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
It shall not neither. You
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery
To save this brat's life?
Any thing
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
To save the innocent: any thing possible.
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding.
I will
Mark and perform it
Of any point in't shall not only be
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
It came to us
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
I swear to do this
Had been more merciful. Come on
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity. Sir
In more than this deed does require! And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side

If the event o' the journey
Prove as successful to the queen
As it hath been to us rare

Will clear or end the business: when the oracle
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!

Leontes
arraigned of high treason
with Polixenes
with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
lord the king
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open
of a true subject
their better safety
Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
Being counted falsehood
Behold our human actions
False accusation blush and tyranny
Tremble at patience. You
Hath been as continent
Than history can pattern
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
A fellow of the royal bed
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
Who please to come and hear. For life
As I weigh grief
To your own conscience
Came to your court
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
The bound of honour
That way inclining
Of all that hear me
Cry fie upon my grave!
I ne'er heard yet
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first.
That's true enough;
Through 'tis a saying
You will not own it.
More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes
I loved him as in honour he required
A lady like me
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend
That it was yours. Now
For me to try how: all I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man;
And why he left your court
You knew of his departure
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
Sir
My life stands in the level of your dreams
Your actions are my dreams;
You had a bastard by Polixenes
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
Thy brat hath been cast out
Shalt feel our justice
Look for no less than death.
Sir
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
To me can life be no commodity:
The crown and comfort of my life
And first-fruits of my body
I am barr'd
Starr'd most unluckily
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
The child-bed privilege denied
To women of all fashion; lastly
Here to this place
I have got strength of limit. Now
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life
Upon surmises
But what your jealousies awake
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all
Apollo be my judge!
This your request
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth
Exeunt certain Officers
The Emperor of Russia was my father:
O that he were alive
His daughter's trial! that he did but see
The flatness of my misery
Of pity
Re-enter Officers
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice
Been both at Delphos
The seal'd-up oracle
Of great Apollo's priest; and that
Nor read the secrets in't.
All this we swear.
Break up the seals and read.
"[Reads]	Hermione is chaste;"
Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes
a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;
and the king shall live without an heir
which is lost be not found.
Now blessed be the great Apollo!
Praised!
Hast thou read truth?
Ay
As it is here set down.
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
Enter Servant
My lord the king
What is the business?
O sir
The prince your son
Of the queen's speed
How! gone!
Is dead.
Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
Do strike at my injustice.
HERMIONE swoons
How now there!
This news is mortal to the queen: look down
And see what death is doing.
Take her hence:
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
Beseech you
Some remedies for life.
Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies
Apollo
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes
For
To bloody thoughts and to revenge
Camillo for the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes: which had been done
My swift command
Reward did threaten and encourage him
And fill'd with honour
Unclasp'd my practise
Of all encertainties himself commended
Thorough my rust! and how his pity
Does my deeds make the blacker!
Re-enter PAULINA
Woe the while!
O
What fit is this
What studied torments
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
Must I receive
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies
For girls of nine
And then run mad indeed
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
That thou betray'dst Polixenes
That did but show thee
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
To be or none or little; though a devil
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
Nor is't directly laid to thee
Of the young prince
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not
Not dropp'd down yet.
The higher powers forbid!
I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
Prevail not
Tincture or lustre in her lip
As I would do the gods. But
Do not repent these things
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together
In storm perpetual
To look that way thou wert.
Go on
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
All tongues to talk their bitterest.
Say no more:
Howe'er the business goes
I' the boldness of your speech.
I am sorry for't:
All faults I make
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
At my petition; I beseech you
Let me be punish'd
Of what you should forget. Now
Sir
The love I bore your queen--lo
I'll speak of her no more
I'll not remember you of my own lord
Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth; which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
The causes of their death appear
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
The chapel where they lie
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
Unto these sorrows.
Exeunt
SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.
Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child
Thou art perfect then
The deserts of Bohemia?
Ay
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience
And frown upon 's.
Their sacred wills be done! Go
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
I call upon thee.
Make your best haste
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
Besides
Of prey that keep upon't.
Go thou away:
I'll follow instantly.
I am glad at heart
To be so rid o' the business.
Exit
Come
I have heard
May walk again: if such thing be
Appear'd to me last night
So like a waking. To me comes a creature
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me
Became two spouts: the fury spent
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus
Of my poor babe
Is counted lost for ever
Put on thee by my lord
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so
She melted into air. Affrighted much
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
Yet for this once
Hermione hath suffer'd death
Apollo would
Of King Polixenes
Of its right father. Blossom
There lie
Which may
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
A lullaby too rough: I never saw
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
I am gone for ever.
Exit
Enter a Shepherd
I would there were no age between sixteen and
three-and-twenty
rest; for there is nothing in the between but
getting wenches with child
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
best sheep
than the master: if any where I have them
the seaside
will what have we here! Mercy on 's
pretty barne! A boy or a child
pretty one; a very pretty one: sure
though I am not bookish
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
some stair-work
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
but even now. Whoa
Enter Clown
Hilloa
What
on when thou art dead and rotten
ailest thou
I have seen two such sights
but I am not to say it is a sea

a bodkin's point.
Why
I would you did but see how it chafes

sometimes to see 'em

his name was Antigonus
end of the ship

sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him
the sea or weather.
Name of mercy
Now
sights: the men are not yet cold under water
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
now.
Would I had been by
I would you had been by the ship side
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here
dying
thee; look thee
child! look thee here; take up
open't. So
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
open't. What's within
You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
are forgiven you
This is fairy gold
with't
We are lucky
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come
boy
Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
are hungry: if there be any of him left
it.
That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
which is left of him what he is
sight of him.
Marry
'Tis a lucky day

ACT IV
SCENE I:
Enter Time
I
Of good and bad
To me or my swift passage
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
Of that wide gap
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
The same I am
Or what is now received: I witness to
The times that brought them in; so shall I do
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
The glistering of this present
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving
That he shuts up himself
In fair Bohemia
I now name to you; and with speed so pace
To speak of Perdita
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
Be known when 'tis brought forth.
A shepherd's daughter
If never
He wishes earnestly you never may.
Exit
SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.
Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO
I pray thee
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
grant this.
It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
I have for the most part been aired abroad
desire to lay my bones there. Besides
king
sorrows I might be some allay
think so
As thou lovest me
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou
made me businesses which none without thee can
sufficiently manage
them thyself or take away with thee the very
services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
considered
thankful to thee shall be my study
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
country
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
penitent
and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
Say to me
son? Kings are no less unhappy
being gracious
they have approved their virtues.
Sir
his happier affairs may be
have missingly noted
from court and is less frequent to his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
I have considered so much
care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
intelligence
most homely shepherd; a man
very nothing
neighbours
I have heard
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
That's likewise part of my intelligence; but
fear
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will
appearing what we are
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
Prithee
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
I willingly obey your command.
My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.
Exeunt
SCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.
Enter AUTOLYCUS
When daffodils begin to peer
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
The lark
I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
But shall I go mourn for that
The pale moon shines by night:
And when I wander here and there
If tinkers may have leave to live
My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
being
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
drab I purchased this caparison
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
me: for the life to come
of it. A prize! a prize!
Enter Clown
Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
shorn. what comes the wool to?
[Aside]
If the springe hold
I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
hath made her mistress of the feast
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
the shearers
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
one puritan amongst them
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies; mace; dates?--none
nutmegs
may beg; four pound of prunes
raisins o' the sun.
O that ever I was born!
Grovelling on the ground
I' the name of me--
O
then
Alack
on thee
O sir
than the stripes I have received
ones and millions.
Alas
great matter.
I am robbed
ta'en from me
me.
What
A footman
Indeed
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat
O
Alas
O
shoulder-blade is out.
How now! canst stand?
[Picking his pocket]
Softly
a charitable office.
Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
No
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence
any thing I want: offer me no money
that kills my heart.
What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
A fellow
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
prince: I cannot tell
virtues it was
His vices
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
there; and yet it will no more but abide.
Vices
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
process-server
motion of the Prodigal Son
wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
and
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
Out upon him! prig
wakes
Very true
put me into this apparel.
Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
but looked big and spit at him
I must confess to you
false of heart that way; and that he knew
him.
How do you now?
Sweet sir
walk: I will even take my leave of you
softly towards my kinsman's.
Shall I bring thee on the way?
No
Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
sheep-shearing.
Prosper you
Exit Clown
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
make not this cheat bring out another and the
shearers prove sheep
put in the book of virtue!

Jog on
A merry heart goes all the day
Exit
SCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.
Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA
These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Do give a life: no shepherdess
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
Is as a meeting of the petty gods
Sir
O
With a swain's wearing
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom
To see you so attired
I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
Thy father's ground.
Now Jove afford you cause!
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
To think your father
How would he look
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
Should I
The sternness of his presence?
Apprehend
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
Became a bull
A ram
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer
Run not before mine honour
Burn hotter than my faith.
O
Opposed
One of these two must be necessities
change this purpose
Thou dearest Perdita
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine
Mine own
I be not thine. To this I am most constant
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
Lift up your countenance
Of celebration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come.
O lady Fortune
See
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly
Enter Shepherd
Fie
This day she was both pantler
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here
On his shoulder
With labour and the thing she took to quench it
The hostess of the meeting: pray you
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
A way to make us better friends
Come
That which you are
[To POLIXENES]                  Sir
It is my father's will I should take on me
The hostess-ship o' the day.
To CAMILLO
You're welcome
Give me those flowers there
Seeming and savour all the winter long:
Grace and remembrance be to you both
Shepherdess
With flowers of winter.
Sir
Of trembling winter
flowers o' the season
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
To get slips of them.
Wherefore
For I have heard it said
There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating nature.
Say there be;
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean: so
Which you say adds to nature
That nature makes. You see
A gentler scion to the wildest stock
By bud of nobler race: this is an art
Which does mend nature
The art itself is nature.
So it is.
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors
I'll not put
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
No more than were I painted I would wish
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
Hot lavender
The marigold
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
Of middle summer
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
I should leave grazing
Out
You'd be so lean
Would blow you through and through.
Now
Become your time of day; and yours
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina
From Dis's waggon! daffodils
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
That die unmarried
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds
What
No
Not like a corse; or if
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition.
What you do
Still betters what is done. When you speak
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing
A wave o' the sea
Nothing but that; move still
O Doricles
I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
To put you to't. But come; our dance
Your hand
I'll swear for 'em.
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
But smacks of something greater than herself
He tells her something
That makes her blood look out: good sooth
The queen of curds and cream.
Come on
Mopsa must be your mistress: marry
Now
Not a word
Come
Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses
Pray
Which dances with your daughter?
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe it;
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
I think so too; for never gazed the moon
Upon the water as he'll stand and read
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best.
She dances featly.
So she does any thing; though I report it
Do light upon her
Which he not dreams of.
Enter Servant
O master
door
pipe; no
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
ears grew to his tunes.
He could never come better; he shall come in. I
love a ballad but even too well
matter merrily set down
indeed and sung lamentably.
He hath songs for man or woman
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
bawdry
burthens of dildos and fadings
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would
the matter
no harm
'Whoop
This is a brave fellow.
Believe me
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle
gross: inkles
sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a she-angel
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.
Exit Servant
You have of these pedlars
than you'ld think
Ay
Enter AUTOLYCUS
Lawn as white as driven snow;
Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
Masks for faces and for noses;
Bugle bracelet
Golden quoifs and stomachers
Pins and poking-sticks of steel
Come buy of me
Buy lads
If I were not in love with Mopsa
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
I was promised them against the feast; but they come
not too late now.
He hath promised you more than that
He hath paid you all he promised you; may be
paid you more
Is there no manners left among maids? will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? Is there not milking-time
going to bed
secrets
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
your tongues
I have done. Come
and a pair of sweet gloves.
Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
and lost all my money?
And indeed
therefore it behoves men to be wary.
Fear not thou
I hope so
What hast here? ballads?
Pray now
life
Here's one to a very doleful tune
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
toads carbonadoed.
Is it true
Very true
Bless me from marrying a usurer!
Here's the midwife's name to't
Tale-porter
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
Pray you now
Come on
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.
Here's another ballad of a fish
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
Is it true too
Five justices' hands at it
my pack will hold.
Lay it by too: another.
This is a merry ballad
Let's have some merry ones.
Why
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
request
We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
We had the tune on't a month ago.
I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
occupation; have at it with you.
SONG
Get you hence
Where it fits not you to know.
Whither?
O
Whither?
It becomes thy oath full well
Me too
Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
If to either
Neither.
What
Neither.
Thou hast sworn my love to be.
Thou hast sworn it more to me:
Then whither goest? say
We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk
not trouble them. Come
me. Wenches
have the first choice. Follow me
Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA
And you shall pay well for 'em.
Follows singing
Will you buy any tape
Any silk
Come to the pedlar;
Money's a medler.
That doth utter all men's ware-a.
Exit
Re-enter Servant
Master

bowling
Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
homely foolery already. I know
You weary those that refresh us: pray
these four threes of herdsmen.
One three of them
danced before the king; and not the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
Leave your prating: since these good men are
pleased
Why
Exit
Here a dance of twelve Satyrs
O
To CAMILLO
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
He's simple and tells much.
To FLORIZEL
How now
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting. Sooth
And handed love as you do
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
To her acceptance; you have let him go
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty
For a reply
Of happy holding her.
Old sir
She prizes not such trifles as these are:
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
Up in my heart; which I have given already
Before this ancient sir
snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts twice o'er.
What follows this?
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
But to your protestation; let me hear
What you profess.
Do
And this my neighbour too?
And he
Than he
That
That ever made eye swerve
More than was ever man's
Without her love; for her employ them all;
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition.
Fairly offer'd.
This shows a sound affection.
But
I cannot speak
So well
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.
Take hands
And
I give my daughter to him
Her portion equal his.
O
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead
Enough then for your wonder. But
Come
And
Soft
Have you a father?
I have: but what of him?
Knows he of this?
He neither does nor shall.
Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
But what he did being childish?
No
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age.
By my white beard
Something unfilial: reason my son
Should choose himself a wife
The father
But fair posterity
In such a business.
I yield all this;
But for some other reasons
My father of this business.
Let him know't.
He shall not.
Prithee
No
Let him
At knowing of thy choice.
Come
Mark our contract.
Mark your divorce
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir
But shorten thy life one week. And thou
Of excellent witchcraft
The royal fool thou copest with
O
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers
More homely than thy state. For thee
That thou no more shalt see this knack
I mean thou shalt
Not hold thee of our blood
Follow us to the court. Thou churl
From the dead blow of it. And you
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea
These rural latches to his entrance open
As thou art tender to't.
Exit
Even here undone!
I was not much afeard; for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
Looks on alike. Will't please you
I told you what would come of this: beseech you
Being now awake
Why
Speak ere thou diest.
I cannot speak
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
You have undone a man of fourscore three
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
If I might die within this hour
To die when I desire.
Exit
Why look you so upon me?
I am but sorry
More straining on for plucking back
My leash unwillingly.
Gracious my lord
He will allow no speech
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
Will he endure your sight as yet
Then
I not purpose it.
I think
Even he
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
How often said
But till 'twere known!
It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith; and then
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
From my succession wipe me
Am heir to my affection.
Be advised.
I am
Will thereto be obedient
If not
This is desperate
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo
Be thereat glean'd
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
In unknown fathoms
To this my fair beloved: therefore
To see him any more
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
Tug for the time to come. This you may know
And so deliver
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
And most opportune to our need I have
A vessel rides fast by
For this design. What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge
Concern me the reporting.
O my lord!
I would your spirit were easier for advice
Hark
Drawing her aside
I'll hear you by and by.
He's irremoveable
His going I could frame to serve my turn
And that unhappy king
I so much thirst to see.
Now
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony.
Sir
You have heard of my poor services
That I have borne your father?
Very nobly
Have you deserved: it is my father's music
To speak your deeds
To have them recompensed as thought on.
Well
And through him what is nearest to him
Your gracious self
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration
As shall become your highness; where you may
Enjoy your mistress
As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her
And bring him up to liking.
How
That I may call thee something more than man
And after that trust to thee.
Have you thought on
A place whereto you'll go?
Not any yet:
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
To what we wildly do
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows.
Then list to me:
This follows
But undergo this flight
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time.
Worthy Camillo
Hold up before him?
Sent by the king your father
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir
What you as from your father shall deliver
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say; that he shall not perceive
But that you have your father's bosom there
And speak his very heart.
I am bound to you:
There is some sap in this.
A cause more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To unpath'd waters
To miseries enough; no hope to help you
Nothing so certain as your anchors
Do their best office
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
Prosperity's the very bond of love
Affliction alters.
One of these is true:
I think affliction may subdue the cheek
Yea
There shall not at your father's house these
seven years
Be born another such.
My good Camillo
She is i' the rear our birth.
I cannot say 'tis pity
She lacks instructions
To most that teach.
Your pardon
I'll blush you thanks.
My prettiest Perdita!
But O
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son
My lord
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
The scene you play were mine. For instance
They talk aside
Re-enter AUTOLYCUS
Ha
sworn brother
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone
ribbon
should buy first
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what I saw
remembered. My clown
be a reasonable man
wenches' song
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had not the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
son and scared my choughs from the chaff
left a purse alive in the whole army.
CAMILLO
Nay
So soon as you arrive
And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
Shall satisfy your father.
Happy be you!
All that you speak shows fair.
Who have we here?
Seeing AUTOLYCUS
We'll make an instrument of this
Nothing may give us aid.
If they have overheard me now
How now
not
I am a poor fellow
Why
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly
change garments with this gentleman: though the
pennyworth on his side be the worst
I am a poor fellow

I know ye well enough.
Nay
flayed already.
Are you in earnest

I smell the trick on't.
Dispatch
Indeed
conscience take it.
Unbuckle
FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments
Fortunate mistress
Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
And pluck it o'er your brows
The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
Get undescried.
I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part.
No remedy.
Have you done there?
Should I now meet my father
Nay
Giving it to PERDITA
Come
Adieu
O Perdita
Pray you
[Aside]  What I do next
Of this escape and whither they are bound;
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
To force him after: in whose company
I shall review Sicilia
I have a woman's longing.
Fortune speed us!
Thus we set on
The swifter speed the better.
Exeunt FLORIZEL
I understand the business
open ear
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
this year connive at us
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king withal
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
and therein am I constant to my profession.
Re-enter Clown and Shepherd
Aside
every lane's end
See
There is no other way but to tell the king
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
Nay
Nay
Go to
She being none of your flesh and blood
and blood has not offended the king; and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
those things you found about her
things
done
I will tell the king all
son's pranks too; who
me the king's brother-in-law.
Indeed
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
[Aside]  Very wisely
Well
fardel will make him scratch his beard.
[Aside]  I know not what impediment this complaint
may be to the flight of my master.
Pray heartily he be at palace.
[Aside]  Though I am not naturally honest
sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.
Takes off his false beard
How now
To the palace
Your affairs there
of that fardel
names
thing that is fitting to be known
We are but plain fellows
A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with stamped coin
they do not give us the lie.
Your worship had like to have given us one
had not taken yourself with the manner.
Are you a courtier
Whether it like me or no
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou
business
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
open thy affair.
My business
What advocate hast thou to him?
I know not
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
have none.
None
How blessed are we that are not simple men!
Yet nature might have made me as these are
This cannot be but a great courtier.
His garments are rich
them not handsomely.
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
a great man
on's teeth.
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
Wherefore that box?
Sir
shall know within this hour
speech of him.
Age
Why
The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for
know the king is full of grief.
So 'tis said
married a shepherd's daughter.
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast
the curses he shall have
feel
Think you so
Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
him
under the hangman: which though it be great pity
ram-tender
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
is too soft for him
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few
Has the old man e'er a son
like you
He has a son
'nointed over with honey
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead; then recovered again with
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then
he is

sun looking with a southward eye upon him
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals
are to be smiled at
capital? Tell me
men
gently considered
aboard
besides the king to effect your suits
shall do it.
He seems to be of great authority: close with him
bear
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand
An't please you
us
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
After I have done what I promised?
Ay
Well
In some sort
one
O
Comfort
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed
pawn till it be brought you.
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
hedge and follow you.
We are blest in this man
Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
Exeunt Shepherd and Clown
If I had a mind to be honest
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
courted now with a double occasion
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
these two moles
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing
officious; for I am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
them: there may be matter in it.

ACT V
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.
Enter LEONTES
Sir
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make
More penitence than done trespass: at the last
With them forgive yourself.
Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues
My blemishes in them
The wrong I did myself; which was so much
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
Bred his hopes out of.
TRUE
If
Would be unparallel'd.
I think so. Kill'd!
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
Sorely
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now
Not at all
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Have done the time more benefit and graced
Your kindness better.
You are one of those
Would have him wed again.
If you would not so
Of his most sovereign name; consider little
What dangers
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
What holier than
With a sweet fellow to't?
There is none worthy

For has not the divine Apollo said
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come again to me; who
My lord should to the heavens be contrary
To LEONTES
Care not for issue;
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
Was like to be the best.
Good Paulina
Had squared me to thy counsel! then
And left them
More rich for what they yielded.
Thou speak'st truth.
No more such wives; therefore
Again possess her corpse
Had she such power
She had; and would incense me
To murder her I married.
I should so.
Were I the ghost that walk'd
Her eye
You chose her; then I'ld shriek
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
Should be 'Remember mine.'
Stars
I'll have no wife
Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave?
Never
Then
You tempt him over-much.
Unless another
Good madam
I have done.
Yet
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
As was your former; but she shall be such
As
To see her in your arms.
My true Paulina
That
Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
Never till then.
Enter a Gentleman
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel
The fairest I have yet beheld
To your high presence.
What with him? he comes not
Like to his father's greatness: his approach
'Tis not a visitation framed
By need and accident. What train?
But few
His princess
Ay
O Hermione
Above a better gone
Give way to what's seen now! Sir
Have said and writ so
Is colder than that theme
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd
Pardon
The one I have almost forgot
The other
Of all professors else
Of who she but bid follow.
How! not women?
Women will love her
More worth than any man; men
The rarest of all women.
Go
Yourself
Exeunt CLEOMENES and others
He thus should steal upon us.
Had our prince
Well with this lord: there was not full a month
Between their births.
Prithee
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure
Will bring me to consider that which may
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
Re-enter CLEOMENES and others
Your mother was most true to wedlock
For she did print your royal father off
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
And your fair princess
I lost a couple
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
You
All mine own folly--the society
Once more to look on him.
By his command
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
Give you all greetings that a king
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
His wish'd ability
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
And those that bear them living.
O my brother
Afresh within me
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage
The adventure of her person?
Good my lord
Where the warlike Smalus
Most royal sir

For visiting your highness: my best train
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
Who for Bohemia bend
Not only my success in Libya
Here where we are.

Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Do climate here! You have a holy father
For which the heavens
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been
Enter a Lord
Most noble sir
Desires you to attach his son
His dignity and duty both cast off--
Fled from his father
A shepherd's daughter.
Where's Bohemia? speak.
Here in your city; I now came from him:
I speak amazedly; and it becomes
My marvel and my message. To your court
Whiles he was hastening
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother
With this young prince.
Camillo has betray'd me;
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
Endured all weathers.
Lay't so to his charge:
He's with the king your father.
Who? Camillo?
Camillo
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
Wretches so quake: they kneel
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
Bohemia stops his ears
With divers deaths in death.
O my poor father!
The heaven sets spies upon us
Our contract celebrated.
You are married?
We are not
The stars
The odds for high and low's alike.
My lord
She is
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry
Where you were tied in duty
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
Dear
Though Fortune
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you
Than I do now: with thought of such affections
My father will grant precious things as trifles.
Would he do so
Sir
'Fore your queen died
Than what you look on now.
I thought of her
To FLORIZEL
But your petition
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires
I now go toward him; therefore follow me
And mark what way I make: come

SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.
Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman
Beseech you
I was by at the opening of the fardel
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
heard the shepherd say
I would most gladly know the issue of it.
I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost
staring on one another
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
beholder
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
extremity of the one
Enter another Gentleman
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
The news
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
cannot be able to express it.
Enter a third Gentleman
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
deliver you more. How goes it now
which is called true is so like an old tale
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
found his heir?
Most true
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
see
of Queen Hermione's
know to be his character
creature in resemblance of the mother
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the two kings?
No.
Then have you lost a sight
joy crown another
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes
distraction that they were to be known by garment
himself for joy of his found daughter
joy were now become a loss
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
shepherd
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
another encounter
and undoes description to do it.
What
hence the child?
Like an old tale still
rehearse
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
innocence
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
What became of his bark and his followers?
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found. But O
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
of losing.
The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.
One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
angled for mine eyes
the fish
death
confessed and lamented by the king
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till
sign of dolour to another
I would fain say
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
colour; some swooned
could have seen 't
Are they returned to the court?
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Italian master
eternity and could put breath into his work
beguile Nature of her custom
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
answer: thither with all greediness of affection
are they gone
I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day
since the death of Hermione
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing?
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Let's along.
Exeunt Gentlemen
Now
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
at that time
sea-sick
weather continuing
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
been the finder out of this secret
have relished among my other discredits.
Enter Shepherd and Clown
Here come those I have done good to against my will
Come
daughters will be all gentlemen born.
You are well met
this other day
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
lie
I know you are now
Ay
And so have I
So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
father; for the king's son took me by the hand
called me brother; and then the two kings called my
father brother; and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and
so we wept
tears that ever we shed.
We may live
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck
preposterous estate as we are.
I humbly beseech you
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master.
Prithee
gentlemen.
Thou wilt amend thy life?
Ay
Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
You may say it
Not swear it
franklins say it
How if it be false
If it be ne'er so false
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but I'll swear it
be a tall fellow of thy hands.
I will prove so
Ay
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk
being a tall fellow
and the princes
queen's picture. Come
good masters.

SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.
Enter LEONTES
O grave and good Paulina
That I have had of thee!
What
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed
Heirs of your kingdoms
My life may last to answer.
O Paulina
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
Have we pass'd through
In many singularities; but we saw not
That which my daughter came to look upon
As she lived peerless
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
Lonely
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
Still sleep mock'd death: behold
PAULINA draws a curtain
I like your silence
Your wonder: but yet speak; first
Her natural posture!
Chide me
Thou art Hermione; or rather
In thy not chiding
As infancy and grace. But yet
So aged as this seems.
O
So much the more our carver's excellence;
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
As she lived now.
As now she might have done
Now piercing to my soul. O
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
For being more stone than it? O royal piece
My evils conjured to remembrance and
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits
And give me leave
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady
O
The statue is but newly fix'd
My lord
Did ever so long live; no sorrow
But kill'd itself much sooner.
Dear my brother
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself.
Indeed
Would thus have wrought you
I'ld not have show'd it.
Do not draw the curtain.
No longer shall you gaze on't
May think anon it moves.
Let be
Would I were dead
What was he that did make it? See
Did verily bear blood?
Masterly done:
The very life seems warm upon her lip.
The fixture of her eye has motion in't
I'll draw the curtain:
My lord's almost so far transported that
He'll think anon it lives.
O sweet Paulina
No settled senses of the world can match
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
I am sorry
I could afflict you farther.
Do
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort. Still
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me
Good my lord
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
You'll mar it if you kiss it
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
No
So long could I
Stand by
Either forbear
For more amazement. If you can behold it
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
Which I protest against--I am assisted
By wicked powers.
What you can make her do
To make her speak as move.
It is required
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
On: those that think it is unlawful business
I am about
Proceed:
No foot shall stir.
Music
Music
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
HERMIONE comes down
Start not; her actions shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
Until you see her die again; for then
You kill her double. Nay
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
Is she become the suitor?
O
If this be magic
Lawful as eating.
She embraces him.
She hangs about his neck:
If she pertain to life let her speak too.
Ay
That she is living
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives
Please you to interpose
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn
Our Perdita is found.
You gods
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I
Gave hope thou wast in being
Myself to see the issue.
There's time enough for that;
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like relation. Go together
Partake to every one. I
My mate
O
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
But how
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
For him
An honourable husband. Come
Is richly noted and here justified
By us
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law
Each one demand an answer to his part
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
